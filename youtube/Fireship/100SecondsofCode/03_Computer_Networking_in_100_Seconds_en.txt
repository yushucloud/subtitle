networking it's the way computers exchange information around the world

and just like the burrito its architecture is abstracted into seven

layers based on the open systems interconnection model

at the bottom we have physical hardware like fiber optic cables that literally

carry light from point a to point b somehow this light travels all the way

to layer seven where it can be transmitted directly into your

consciousness in the form of pixels on a screen or vibrations from a speaker

that's exactly what you're doing right now as an end user accessing this video

over the hypertext transfer protocol in addition to http there are many other

protocols at layer 7 like smpt for email or ftp for file

transfers now let's work our way backwards to

understand how we got here layer 6 is the presentation layer and

essentially it works as a translator to ensure that a stream of bits from a

computer like a jpeg image is encoded to a

standard format that can be used at the application layer

below that we have the session layer which is responsible for managing the

connection between two computers it's here we have things like user

authentication and authorization to control whether or not a user has

access to data on a server we've all been on a zoom call where some

random person joins and shares their unsolicited artwork they manage to

authenticate on zoom servers by exploiting layer 5

and that brings us to the middle of the stack the transport layer

the transmission control protocol or tcp is the foundation for

pretty much everything we've looked at so far its job is to take a stream of

data from one computer and transfer it to another it determines

how to segment the data into smaller pieces that can be sent over the network

in the correct order it receives the data from layer 4 the

network layer in the form of packets it's here we find the internet protocol

every computer connected to the network has its own unique ip address

which identifies that computer and whenever it sends information over the

network it does so in the form of an ip packet

that contains that address in the header a packet is just a unit of data along

with some information about who sent it this happens from a router or gateway

which connects to layer two the data link and its role is to connect

one physical node in the network to another via protocols like ethernet or

wi-fi and that is how over 2.5 quintillion

bytes of data are shared around the world every single day
