00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,120
c plus plus a statically typed compiled


2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,640
programming language famous for its


3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,920
widespread use and software


4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,759
infrastructure and infamous for its


5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,440
steep learning curve it was created in


6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
1979 by bjorn strausstrup at at t bell


7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
labs he was inspired by the


8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,480
object-oriented nature of simula but


9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,600
needed a language with a high


10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
performance of c and thus c with classes


11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
was born it's designed as a superset of


12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,080
c which means that virtually any c


13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,320
program is also a valid c plus plus


14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
program but it also adds zero overhead


15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,720
abstractions such as object oriented


16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
patterns like polymorphism encapsulation


17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
and inheritance today it's used in a


18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
wide variety of systems with constrained


19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,879
memory demands like the unreal engine


20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
for aaa video games programs like adobe


21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,719
after effects that were used to edit


22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
this video databases like mysql and


23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
mongodb embedded systems like the


24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
display on your smart toaster and is


25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
used to implement much of our low-level


26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,239
infrastructure like language compilers


27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,239
and virtual machines it's so popular


28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,840
because it provides low-level memory and


29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
hardware control like c but with high


30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
level abstractions like classes and


31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
smart pointers c plus plus makes it


32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
harder to shoot yourself in the foot but


33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,720
when you do it'll blow your whole leg


34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,159
off


35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,720
to get started install a c plus compiler


36
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,119
like gcc or clang then create a file


37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,680
ending in cpp include io stream from the


38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,520
standard library to handle input and


39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
output your code will start executing


40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
from the main function to print hello


41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
world we simply use standard character


42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,560
output followed by the bitwise shift


43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
left operator and a string literal we


44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,479
can get rid of this std though by adding


45
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
a namespace to the top of the file now


46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,079
if we want to create a string variable


47
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,240
we can do so by typing it as an array of


48
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
characters however if we include string


49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
from the standard library we can use the


50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
string type instead the real game


51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,680
changer though is the fact that c plus


52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
plus supports object-oriented


53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,439
programming with classes a class is just


54
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,680
a blueprint for an object inside a class


55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
you can define attributes and methods


56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
that will be private by default or make


57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
them public by adding them under the


58
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
public specifier it's also possible to


59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
define methods outside the class


60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
definition using a double colon methods


61
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
can also be defined multiple times with


62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
different parameters which is known as


63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
overloading and is a form of


64
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,759
polymorphism in addition we can define


65
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
constructors and destructors to run code


66
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,160
when an object is created or destroyed


67
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
classes also support inheritance


68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
allowing developers to more efficiently


69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,200
share logic throughout a program to


70
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
instantiate an object type the class


71
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,800
name followed by the name of your object


72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
and optionally any parameters for the


73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,319
constructor when it comes to memory we


74
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
could manage everything manually with


75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,239
pointers and references however tools


76
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,080
like unique pointer can get the job done


77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
in a way that's easier and safer by


78
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
ensuring that only one object can be


79
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
allocated to memory now to run your code


80
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
open up the terminal and use a tool like


81
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
clang plus plus to compile it


82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
this has been c plus in 100 seconds hit
