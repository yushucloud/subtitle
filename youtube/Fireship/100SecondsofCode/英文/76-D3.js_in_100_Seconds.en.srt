1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
data driven documents or d3 is a


2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,880
javascript library for creating


3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,879
interactive data visualizations with


4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,800
scalable vector graphics if you've ever


5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,040
been to a website that has a graph map


6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
scatter plot histogram dependency


7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,120
diagram b swarm tree map or pie chart


8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
it's probably powered by d3 under the


9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,840
hood it was created in 2011 with the


10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
goal of generating svg graphics from


11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
data drawing a data visualization by


12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
hand is extremely difficult with d3 you


13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
start with some input data then write


14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
some javascript to programmatically draw


15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
the graphic for you which can then be


16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,160
made interactive with things like labels


17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
and controls and when the underlying


18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,920
data changes it can interpolate and


19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
animate between values resulting in a


20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
beautiful visual for the end user that's


21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
built entirely on web standards that you


22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,160
already know like html css and


23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,960
javascript its api allows you to select


24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,039
and manipulate items in the dom not much


25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,640
different than something like jquery


26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,559
what makes d3 different is that you can


27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,559
set properties as functions that


28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
automatically draw different graphics


29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480
based on your data to get started you'll


30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,160
first want to grab an element from the


31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,479
dom with the select method like an empty


32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,880
svg you could then draw a single shape


33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,960
inside of it with the append method and


34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,880
customize its appearance by chaining the


35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,720
attribute method to it that draws a


36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,799
single shape but the real power of d3


37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,720
comes into play when you attach data to


38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,799
a selection instead of using a for loop


39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
to draw a bunch of shapes the select all


40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
method allows you to describe how to


41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
draw shape making your code more


42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
declarative you can then attach data to


43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
it in the form of an array or an


44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,840
external file and it will draw a shape


45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
for every point in your data set each


46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
point has three possible states enter


47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,400
update and exit enter is when you would


48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
initially draw your shape but d3 also


49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
keeps track of changes to the data set


50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
allowing you to react when data is


51
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
updated or removed it also provides a


52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
bunch of features to make your data look


53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,840
beautiful like helpers that


54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
automatically draw scales along the x


55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
and y axis based on the domain and range


56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,479
of the data or you might use transition


57
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
to create an animation as each data


58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,399
point is added to the chart and finally


59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,079
you might listen to events to add


60
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,320
tooltips or other interactive elements


61
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,280
to your chart this has been d3js in 100
