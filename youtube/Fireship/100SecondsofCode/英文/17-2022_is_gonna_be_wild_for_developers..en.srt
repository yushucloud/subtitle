1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
it's hard to make predictions especially


2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
about the future but that's exactly what


3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,319
we'll try to do in this video 2021 was a


4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,919
strange year there was a big regime


5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,679
change we finally beat the pandemic and


6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,280
everybody took off their masks and went


7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
back to the office that was the original


8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,040
plan anyway unfortunately it's your


9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
conspiracy theorist uncle on facebook


10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
who keeps making the right predictions


11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,240
but as developers and entrepreneurs we


12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
don't care about these externalities we


13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,279
figure out ways to make money writing


14
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,720
code with the environment they give us


15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
we thrive in the chaos if you're new


16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
here like and subscribe then we'll start


17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
things off by looking at major trends


18
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,880
that will influence the developer


19
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
landscape in 2022 then for each trend


20
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,960
i'll give you one of my personal weird


21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
app ideas that you can use to build a


22
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,480
quadrillion dollar startup the first


23
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,719
trend we need to talk about is web3 or


24
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,719
the decentralized web some people think


25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,239
web 3 is the point where all modern


26
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,160
technology converges out of which new


27
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
unimaginable technologies will diverge


28
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
in the future other people though think


29
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
that web 3 is just the latest buzzword


30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
to pump crypto scams but what is web3


31
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,800
exactly a completely decentralized


32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,719
version of our current internet with no


33
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,600
firewalls no tolls no


34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,680
government regulation


35
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
you want to build a new internet


36
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
yes it's basically a vision for the


37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
internet where everything is


38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
decentralized and regulated with smart


39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
contracts and crypto instead of the


40
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
current status quo where everything is


41
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
controlled by google facebook and amazon


42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
in a decentralized app or dap the user


43
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,520
owns all their data instead of an email


44
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
password identity users are identified


45
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
by a blockchain wallet address that


46
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,439
usually connects with a browser plugin


47
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
like metamask while the app itself is


48
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,040
code that lives on the blockchain in the


49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
form of a smart contract the idea is


50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
really cool because it gives people real


51
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,240
control over their own slice of the


52
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
internet as opposed to using services


53
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,079
that are mediated by a central ivory


54
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,840
tower like a big tech corporation or


55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,439
government on the other hand there are a


56
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,280
ton of ways one might criticize web3


57
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
it's chaotic hard to develop quality


58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
apps with current tool chains it doesn't


59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,320
benefit most mainstream businesses in


60
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,079
any practical way most of the tokens are


61
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
owned by silicon valley insiders so it's


62
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
not really decentralized at all and you


63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,200
really don't need cryptocurrency to


64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,799
build a decentralized app in the first


65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,479
place if crypto prices collapse for


66
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
whatever reason i think a lot of the


67
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
excitement for web 3 would disappear i


68
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,119
could go on but one of my favorite


69
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
quotes is pessimist sounds smart but


70
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,959
optimists make money building a


71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,720
decentralized internet is not an easy


72
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,400
thing to do there's a huge opportunity


73
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,239
for developers who are willing to tackle


74
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,160
the problems in this space a big part of


75
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
success is timing facebook google and


76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,680
amazon were all in the right place at


77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,160
the right time to capitalize on web 1.0


78
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
and 2.0 i think you should be skeptical


79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
about web3 but if it does go mainstream


80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
you'll be very glad you got in early a


81
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
full web 3 tutorial is on the way so


82
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,879
make sure you're subscribed to my


83
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
channel now here's my web3 startup idea


84
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
it's pretty obvious that the corporate


85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
media is dying not many people in the


86
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
key demo actually trust or watch the


87
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
mainstream media but they can continue


88
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,080
to force feed us this content by making


89
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
it artificially rank high on platforms


90
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,599
like twitter and youtube and even by


91
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,280
removing things like the dislike button


92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
to limit our ability to point out bad


93
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
content what i think would be awesome is


94
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,120
an entirely decentralized news network


95
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
where journalists could upload video


96
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
articles and other reporting and be


97
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
compensated based on its reach it would


98
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
incentivize good journalism and


99
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,800
eliminate the possibility of a top-down


100
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
propaganda machine journalists win


101
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
consumers win the only one who gets


102
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
is the establishment and now a


103
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,239
word from our sponsors hi my name is


104
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
jeff and i'm a 10x developer and you can


105
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
be one too if you start every day with a


106
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
hearty breakfast from mcdonald's like


107
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
the sausage egg mcmuffin value meal


108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
available for a limited time for under


109
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,640
14 remember guys real developers eat at


110
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,760
mcdonald's i'm loving it


111
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,519
and that brings us to our next trend the


112
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,120
metaverse you likely saw mark


113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
zuckerberg's ultra cringe i mean


114
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
inspiring vision about the metaverse i


115
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
pulled the channel and the majority of


116
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,599
you thought the vision was dumb i


117
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,959
totally agree with that because i would


118
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,560
never want to be involved in any kind of


119
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
metaverse run by facebook a company with


120
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
a terrible track record of abusing our


121
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
data and violating our privacy that


122
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,159
being said facebook is not the only


123
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,519
company building a metaverse they're


124
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,200
just trying to hijack the name the


125
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
general concept is to build an


126
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
internet-based platform that has


127
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,319
multiple access points like your phone


128
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,959
vr and ar then you have a single profile


129
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,319
that you can use to interact with


130
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,920
different businesses and apps within


131
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
that platform and communicate with other


132
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
users in a virtual environment like you


133
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,760
would in vrchat or an old school app


134
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
like second life the concept is actually


135
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
really cool but i don't think the vr


136
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,959
aspect of it will ever go super


137
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,720
mainstream vr has been around for a long


138
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,239
time now and the technology is really


139
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,079
good but most people just don't like


140
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,440
using it we already know we're addicted


141
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,359
to social media and video games the idea


142
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,120
of strapping on a headset to further


143
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
detach from the real world just doesn't


144
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
seem like something that humans will do


145
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
that being said metaverses are being


146
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
built and there will be opportunities


147
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
there for developers if you want to get


148
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
into it learning something like unity or


149
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
unreal engine would be a good place to


150
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
start or 3d modeling software like


151
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
blender here's my startup idea there's a


152
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
lot of hype and investment going into


153
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
the metaverse and during a gold rush


154
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
it's a good idea to sell shovels the


155
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
idea is to create something like a


156
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
squarespace or shopify for the metaverse


157
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
a platform where any business can build


158
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,919
some kind of digital metaverse


159
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,000
experience ar and vr apps are extremely


160
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,919
hard to develop if you can give brands a


161
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,280
way to get their foot into the door of


162
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
the metaverse there are likely millions


163
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,479
of potential customers out there that


164
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
will want to interact with customers on


165
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
the metaverse but don't have the


166
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
technical skills to get the job done now


167
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
let's switch gears to the next trend


168
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
artificial intelligence ai has come a


169
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
long way in the last couple years and in


170
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
2021 it affected us developers


171
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
personally with the release of github


172
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
co-pilot which is a tool that uses ai to


173
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
automatically write code for you it's


174
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,759
not to the point where it's going to


175
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,360
replace developers but i'm sure we'll


176
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
get there someday the one thing that's a


177
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
little disappointing about ai is that


178
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
it's kind of dominated now by big


179
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
companies that have control of these


180
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
algorithms like gpt3 it would be


181
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
extremely difficult as an individual or


182
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
startup to train ai models that can


183
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
compete with it for one you won't have


184
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
the massive amount of data needed and


185
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
two you won't have the computing power


186
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,400
point two will become especially true if


187
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,160
quantum computers ever become useful if


188
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
a quantum computer can train an ai model


189
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,520
then it's pretty much game over that


190
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120
being said it's still a good idea to


191
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
learn data science because it's still


192
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
very difficult to process and analyze


193
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
huge amounts of data and that means


194
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,759
there's a lot of high paying jobs out


195
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
there for that role here's my startup


196
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
idea if you can't beat them join them


197
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,639
microsoft has exclusive access to gpt-3


198
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
but there's still a public api where you


199
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
can use gpt3 to build a product a lot of


200
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
people like to interact with psychics


201
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,639
but that business model doesn't scale


202
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
very well because you need to meet with


203
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,680
each client individually what you could


204
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
do is use gpt 3 to create an ai driven


205
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
psychic hotline where customers could


206
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
interact with lost loved ones and gpt3


207
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
would automatically generate responses


208
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
that come from the other side now i want


209
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
to take a minute to talk about something


210
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
a little more boring databases a trend


211
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
that i've noticed is that relational sql


212
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,720
databases are back in vogue sql has


213
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
always been the most widely adopted type


214
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
of database but now it's a cool


215
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,520
technology to use again we're also


216
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
seeing ai being implemented into


217
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
databases like mindsdb to make machine


218
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,199
learning workflows much easier in


219
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
addition you have tools like planetscale


220
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
and supabase who are making relational


221
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,800
databases much easier to work with at


222
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,039
the same time you have no sql databases


223
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
like mongodb becoming more and more


224
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
powerful which can now be deployed in a


225
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
serverless way and supports full text


226
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
search then you have redis becoming a


227
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
multi-model database to support graph


228
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
time series and full text search


229
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
features then you have firestore from


230
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,960
firebase which really didn't change in


231
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
2021 but i'm going to keep my fingers


232
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
crossed for some new features in 2022.


233
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,199
if not the serverless sql platforms are


234
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
looking very appealing here's my startup


235
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
idea databases are boring but boring


236
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
ideas are also ideas that can make money


237
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
if you identify a trend in the industry


238
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
that's going to require a lot of


239
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
specialized developers consider building


240
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
a job board it's a really easy app to


241
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
make and if you market it well it can


242
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,319
make a ton of money like over seven


243
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,759
figures you just need to find a


244
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,360
specialized segment of the market then


245
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
build up a big email list the next big


246
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
trade i want to talk about is javascript


247
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
always bet on javascript if you learn


248
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
javascript you'll never go hungry last


249
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
year i predicted that we're mostly done


250
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
seeing changes to the big frameworks of


251
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
react angular and vue and that


252
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
prediction has held true the core


253
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,080
frameworks are pretty much the same


254
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,520
react concurrent mode is still


255
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,599
experimental just as it was last year


256
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,360
while angular and vue remain solid and


257
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
stable all the exciting stuff is


258
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
happening with the meta frameworks next


259
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
js is the leader in the space and its


260
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,800
parent company versel is now a


261
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,479
multi-billion dollar company what we've


262
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,400
done over the last 20 years is come full


263
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,319
circle originally we had server rendered


264
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
applications then we went to client


265
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
rendered applications and now we have


266
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
things like next js which provide the


267
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,240
best of both worlds next version 3 and


268
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
the view ecosystem looks absolutely


269
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
incredible but it's not feature complete


270
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
at the time of this video we also have


271
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,120
react server components around the


272
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
corner and that's led to new frameworks


273
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,039
like hydrogen from shopify there's also


274
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,479
remix that we looked at in a previous


275
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,840
video but the most interesting


276
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
development in my opinion is the fact


277
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
that rich harris the creator of svelt


278
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
was hired by vercell to work on spelt


279
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
full-time everybody knows that svelt is


280
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,680
the greatest ui framework ever created


281
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,039
but it came a little too late in the


282
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,880
game and never had the financial backing


283
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,719
of a big company that's about to change


284
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,479
which makes me feel very optimistic


285
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,320
about the future of svelt kit a


286
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,160
framework for server side rendering in


287
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,839
addition to meta frameworks you'll also


288
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,440
want to keep your eye on meta meta


289
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,839
frameworks one example is blitz js which


290
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,680
is built on top of next and makes it


291
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,839
much easier to build a database driven


292
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,440
application another really cool


293
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,120
javascript tool worth mentioning is


294
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,959
astro which allows you to build a


295
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,279
website using one or multiple frameworks


296
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
at the same time without sending any


297
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
javascript down to the client build


298
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,720
tools for front-end developers also


299
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
improved a ton in 2021 the best example


300
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,040
is veet which provides a far simpler


301
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
developer experience compared to


302
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
something like webpack it's much faster


303
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
and way easier to work with here's one


304
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
way that you as an independent developer


305
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
can make money around meta frameworks


306
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,279
you might be familiar with sites like


307
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
themeforest that sell premium wordpress


308
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,959
templates many of which are based on


309
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
react vue and angular however if you're


310
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,560
building a server rendered application


311
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
with a meta framework these themes


312
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
aren't very useful i think there's an


313
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
opportunity here to create custom server


314
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,279
render templates that can help other


315
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
developers get things done faster like


316
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,519
next already has an ecommerce template


317
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,640
but there's an infinite number of


318
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
variations you can make on this and also


319
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
provide other templates for e-learning


320
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
small businesses enterprise dashboards


321
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
real estate and all kinds of other


322
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
industries now because next is server


323
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
rendered you can do things beyond the ui


324
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,839
like integrate stripe as a payment


325
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
solution or include sendgrid for


326
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,279
transactional email we now apparently


327
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
have microscopic robots that can


328
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,800
reproduce that being said here's some


329
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,920
other information that you'll want to


330
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
know going into 2022. jetbrains is


331
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,399
releasing a new lightweight ide fleet


332
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
that could compete with vs code the s


333
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
code itself is better than ever and you


334
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
can now run it directly in the browser


335
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
tailwind css is becoming more and more


336
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
popular and it got especially awesome in


337
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,600
2021 thanks to just in time mode


338
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,279
typescript is also more popular than


339
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
ever and we have some cool new features


340
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
coming to the javascript language like


341
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,800
at to get a negative index or the last


342
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
element in an array we have top level


343
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
weight standardized and a much more


344
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
ergonomic way to use object prototype


345
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,760
has own property in 2022 graphql is


346
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,519
still not going to replace rest and the


347
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
hype around it seems to have died down


348
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,959
quite a bit webassembly is not going to


349
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
replace javascript but it is quietly


350
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
changing the world one example is stack


351
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,160
blitz which brings server-side


352
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
capabilities to the browser no code is


353
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
still a trend to keep your eye on but


354
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,959
it's still not going to take your job as


355
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
a developer just like it hasn't for the


356
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
last 50 years when it comes to mobile


357
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,480
development flutter and react native


358
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
will continue to dominate the


359
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
cross-platform space you might see brain


360
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,279
interfaces like neurosity where you


361
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
write code they can react to changes in


362
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,519
your brain waves aws will continue to


363
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,800
release a bunch of products you don't


364
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,399
need while google cloud and azure


365
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,839
continue to play catch-up the only


366
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,920
prediction i'm 100 confident of though


367
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,519
is that things will change and when that


368
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,800
happens i'll be right here in your


369
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
