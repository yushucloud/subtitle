00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
php a dynamic interpreted scripting


3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,720
language for building interactive


4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
websites on the server despite the


5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,320
haters pronouncing it dead it remains


6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
one of the most popular languages for


7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,599
back-end web development it powers


8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,960
content management systems like


9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,559
wordpress top-tier websites like


10
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
wikipedia and countless others via


11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,560
frameworks like laravel and symphony


12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
hell man even facebook uses it although


13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
they built a custom compiler to convert


14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,080
it to machine code on their servers it


15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,119
was created in 1994 by rasmus lyrdorf to


16
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
manage his personal home page clever


17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
acronym but it sounds lame for a


18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
language that powers multi-billion


19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,640
dollar enterprises so today we practice


20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
cognitive dissonance to tell ourselves


21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,120
php stands for hypertext preprocessor it


22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,960
has a special place in history because


23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
it predates javascript and was one of


24
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,239
the first languages to be embedded


25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,719
directly in html allowing websites to be


26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,879
built dynamically on a server it's open


27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,800
source and was one of the technologies


28
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
that revolutionized the web by making


29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
application development accessible to


30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,399
the average person its interpreter is


31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,480
implemented in c and has a syntax


32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,960
inspired by perl to get started create a


33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,920
php file and add some basic html to it


34
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,240
within this file you can go into php


35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
mode by opening a question mark php tag


36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
the code within these tags will be


37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,960
rendered on the server use echo to


38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,799
output a value and the location of the


39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
tag to declare a variable give it a name


40
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
that starts with a dollar sign followed


41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,119
by a value it's a weekly typed language


42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,280
so no type annotations are necessary it


43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,799
also comes with a large number of


44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,720
predefined variables geared towards web


45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
development like git post and cookie


46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
which contain information about the


47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,200
incoming http request now when this code


48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
is rendered on your server it will


49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
output an html string with the php tags


50
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
being replaced by whatever you echoed


51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
the language also supports multiple


52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,640
programming paradigms you have first


53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,479
class functions which can be assigned to


54
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
variables or used anonymously as


55
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,240
arguments and it has tons and tons of


56
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
built-in functions to do pretty much


57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,759
anything a web developer could ever


58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,920
imagine doing it also has a complete


59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,439
object model where you can define


60
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,680
classes with inheritance to implement


61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
object-oriented patterns we're currently


62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
on php version 8 which has all the


63
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
features you would expect from a modern


64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,200
pragmatic language every web developer


65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
should be familiar with it because


66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
statistically there's a 78.5 chance that


67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,200
your client's website is running the


68
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
personal homepage language this has been


69
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,599
php in 100 seconds hit the like button


70
