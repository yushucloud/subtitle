1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,560
visual studio code a free and open


2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,040
source program for editing code software


3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,799
is just a collection of text files


4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
organized in a precise way the s code


5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,480
provides an integrated development


6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,960
environment to help you edit analyze and


7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,719
manage these files efficiently it's a


8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,720
microsoft project that first appeared in


9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,119
2015 as a lightweight cross-platform


10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,960
code editor that ships a new update


11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,400
every single month today it's the


12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,160
world's most popular code editor


13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,320
download it then use it to open a folder


14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,400
that contains your application files


15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
before you can write high quality code


16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
you'll need to make the editor look cool


17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,760
by clicking the settings icon to update


18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,399
your syntax and icon themes next you'll


19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
notice the file explorer contains all


20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,320
the files in this directory open a file


21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,840
and notice how the text inside is


22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,000
colored that's because vs code analyzes


23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,079
the symbols inside the file to perform


24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,360
syntax highlighting it will


25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
automatically detect problems in your


26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,280
code if a variable is not used it


27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
becomes a little more opaque a red


28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,960
squiggly line appears if your code will


29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,879
not compile hover over it for more


30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
details it also creates an outline of


31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
the code structure to quickly navigate


32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,239
to the line of code that you're looking


33
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
for now as you start writing some code


34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,840
in this file you'll notice a little box


35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
pops up as you type professional


36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
developers rarely type every character


37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,439
instead they leverage vs code's


38
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,280
intellisense to autocomplete the code


39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,640
that they were thinking about writing


40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
when the right suggestion comes up hit


41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,159
tab or enter to complete it you might


42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
also right click on your code to find a


43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
variety of options to analyze and


44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
refactor it but almost anything you can


45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
do with the mouse you can do faster with


46
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
the keyboard hit ctrl shift papa to


47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,200
bring up the command palette from here


48
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,119
you can quickly access any vs code


49
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,040
command or any file in your project


50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,640
let's use it to open up a terminal


51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
session which brings up the command line


52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,079
here at the bottom we can use it to run


53
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,159
commands in this project like git init


54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,320
to enable source control or better yet


55
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,159
we can click on the source control icon


56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,840
to run git commands with a visual


57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,479
interface vs code is minimal by design


58
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
but as an open source javascript project


59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
it's easily extendable from the


60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,759
extensions panel you'll find a huge


61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
number of packages that provide


62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,719
specialized tooling for whatever


63
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,079
framework or language you're working


64
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
with most software projects work with


65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
the cloud in some capacity the remote


66
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
button can connect your editor to a


67
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
remote github repository docker


68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
container or cloud server and you can


69
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
even run vs code itself in the cloud to


70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,039
access it from the browser on any


71
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,280
