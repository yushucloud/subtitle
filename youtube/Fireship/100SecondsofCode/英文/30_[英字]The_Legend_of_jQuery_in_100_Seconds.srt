jquery by far the world's most popular javascript library being found on over 80 percent of the world's top 1 million websites that's more than four times the adoption of angular react and view combined it was invented back in 2006 by john resig before most of today's junior developers were even born he originally wanted to call it jselect but all the domains were taken the popularity of jquery is driven by a fundamental need in the web development market javascript is a total and we want to write less of it furthermore back in o6 browsers had a bunch of interop issues jquery provided a single api to handle the edge cases across multiple browsers it's so good in fact that browser vendors of today have standardized many of its features and ship them as native apis you can install it by finding the source code on the website right click to copy it then open dreamweaver and find all of the html pages and paste it into a script tag on each one your javascript now has access to the mighty dollar sign function it takes a selector as its argument like a tag name class or id it'll grab that html from the dom allowing you to perform actions on it in the html we have a list of items and we want to grab the first item in vanilla js we'd have to use this ridiculously long line of code to do so in react we have to completely rewrite our code into a component and implement the confusing ref hook with jquery we can use the dollar sign to grab all the list items and then call first to get the first one it's easy and readable if we want to animate it we can do that by simply chaining a method to it and we can chain more methods to it to register event listeners and all kinds of other fun stuff declarative framework developers love to fight each other about state management don't make me swing on you bro while jquery developers don't have this problem because there's no data layer to worry about instead you just start with an object shade methods to it and let the state manage itself when it comes time to extend jquery there's no need for insanely complex web pack bundling or npm packages you can just extend its prototype with a plugin and there's already a huge ecosystem of plugins to get things done quickly as an added bonus once you've mastered jquery you can jump into jquery mobile and start building native apps for windows phone and blackberry developers of today sometimes make fun of jquery but that's just the stuff you have to deal with when you're the king of javascript libraries this has been the legend of jquery in 100 seconds if you want to see more short videos like this hit the like button and subscribe thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
