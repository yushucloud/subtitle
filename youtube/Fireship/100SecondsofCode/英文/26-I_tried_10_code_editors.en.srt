00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
at exactly 3 45 pm on september 9 1947


2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,359
grace hopper discovered the first


3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,680
official computer bug a real-life moth


4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,599
that found its way onto the number 70


5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
relay of the harvard mark ii aiken relay


6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,160
calculator today computer programmers


7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,839
create their own bugs but that wouldn't


8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,760
be possible without the help of a modern


9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,439
code editor i wanted to find out which


10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,600
code editor is best in the 2020s so i


11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,359
tried to write a basic program with 10


12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,199
different text editors and ides we'll


13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
look at everything from basic command


14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
line editors to the most advanced


15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,160
cloud-based integrated development


16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,840
environments we'll talk about the pros


17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
and cons of each option and look at how


18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,960
these tools have evolved over the last


19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,120
50 years think about this


20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
things like undo find and replace copy


21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
and paste are all commonplace but back


22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
in the 1960s they were revolutionary new


23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,079
features made possible by the computer


24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,079
screen and visual terminal eventually


25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,680
they would replace punch cards where one


26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,199
wrong keystroke meant you had to start


27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
over from scratch the first editor we'll


28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,199
look at is vi which was written by bill


29
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,920
joy and released in 1976. it's still a


30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
standard tool on most linux distros to


31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
this day so to use it all you have to do


32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,760
is type vi into the terminal what's most


33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
interesting is that it's a keyboard


34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,880
based editor the mouse doesn't do


35
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
anything useful that's because the mouse


36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,479
didn't go mainstream until the apple


37
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
macintosh came out in 1984 january 24th


38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
apple computer will introduce macintosh


39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,799
and you'll see why 1984 won't be


40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
like 1984. but do you really need a


41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,759
mouse to code efficiently in vi if you


42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,280
start typing nothing will happen


43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
initially that's because to write some


44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
text you'll need to enter insert mode by


45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
hitting the i key vi is a modal editor


46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
which means the keys on your keyboard do


47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,560
different things based on the mode


48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
you're currently in in insert mode we


49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,159
can add some actual code to the document


50
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,759
then hit escape to go back to command


51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,600
mode and use the right quick command to


52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
save the file to the disk when you get


53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
used to it it can actually be very fast


54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,119
to edit code this way for example to


55
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,960
delete an entire line of code i can hit


56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
double d or 3 d to delete three lines at


57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,439
once without needing to highlight the


58
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,360
entire thing with my mouse the hard part


59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
is memorizing all the tricks to get


60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
things done efficiently vi is nice and


61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
simple but there are a lot of features


62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
missing like syntax highlighting or the


63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
ability to implement plugins to extend


64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,319
its functionality around the same time


65
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,319
period another editor was being created


66
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,360
by guy steele at mit called emacs which


67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,239
stands for editor macros like vi it's


68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
primarily a keyboard based editor but


69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
it's highly extensible and integrates


70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,239
additional features like debuggers a


71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,640
file manager terminal emulator music


72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
player and anything else you can imagine


73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
it's not just a text editor but a


74
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
full-blown integrated development


75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,360
environment that means it can do a lot


76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
more but it takes a lot more time to


77
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
configure on your part initially emacs


78
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
feels a little more user-friendly than


79
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
something like vi we can pull up a menu


80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,319
that allows us to navigate the different


81
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,400
commands and it's a non-modal editor


82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
which means we don't have to understand


83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
what a bunch of different modes do


84
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
before using it however you will need to


85
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,120
use a bunch of modifier keys when typing


86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
which could result in a gruesome injury


87
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
known as emax pinky at the same time


88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,599
it's far from simple and has over 10 000


89
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,200
built-in commands that can be used to


90
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,879
create macros that customize the


91
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,040
experience and automate work now due to


92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
the philosophical differences between


93
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
emacs and vi and the tribal nature of


94
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,480
developers two distinct factions have


95
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720
emerged the cult of vi and the church of


96
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
emacs founded by high priest richard


97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
stallman they've been waging war for


98
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
decades now and people take it very


99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,440
seriously when you go to google to


100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
search for vi it auto-corrects to emacs


101
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
or if you search for emacs it auto


102
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
corrects to bi in modern times though vi


103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
based editors are much more popular and


104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
that brings us to editor number three


105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
vim or vi improved on the surface vim


106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
feels almost identical to vi because


107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
it's a superset of its core


108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
functionality however it's much more


109
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
popular with developers using it as


110
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
their daily editor because it provides a


111
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
ton of other essential features like


112
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,360
syntax highlighting multi-level undo and


113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
plugins to customize and extend its


114
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,959
functionality it's more developer


115
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
friendly and you can enter the vim tutor


116
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,799
command to learn the basics right now


117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
it's kind of annoying at first but once


118
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
you have the basics down you'll find


119
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
that it keeps your fingers on the home


120
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
row of the keyboard which will gradually


121
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,799
improve your coding speed with a lot of


122
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
practice but it also does things like


123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,799
code completion in a regular ide so it's


124
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
not just all about typing faster as you


125
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,080
start to learn it you'll see a lot of


126
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
people make jokes about not being able


127
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,519
to get out of them like developers in


128
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,360
the 60s were writing their own compilers


129
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
but developers today can't even exit


130
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
them without a soy latte and stack


131
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
overflow i don't want to beat off a dead


132
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
horse here so i'm not going to make one


133
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
of those jokes in this video vim was


134
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,840
created in 1991 making it older than


135
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,600
many viewers on this channel but not


136
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
everybody has been happy with its


137
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
evolution and that brings us to a


138
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
popular fork called neovim that came out


139
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,040
in 2015. first of all it's faster than


140
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
vim which is always a plus but one of


141
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,639
the ways you customize vim is with a


142
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,880
scripting language called vim script the


143
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,639
problem is that vimscript sucks


144
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,479
according to this one guy on hacker news


145
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,160
neovim has addressed this problem by


146
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
embedding lua as its scripting language


147
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
an extremely fast and proven language


148
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
that's also used by platforms like


149
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
roblox that's cool and all but what if


150
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
you don't want to spend years mastering


151
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
the art of vim another good option is


152
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
nano which is part of the gnu project


153
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
and came out in 1999. it's also a


154
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
keyboard based editor that you can


155
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
launch from the command line and unlike


156
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
vim it doesn't require modes and has a


157
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
far more gentle learning curve when you


158
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,479
open it you'll notice all the important


159
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,240
keybindings are right here at the bottom


160
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,080
most importantly it tells you control x


161
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
is how you exit so you don't have to


162
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,039
unplug your computer like you would with


163
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,490
vim


164
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,880
[Music]


165
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
it lacks the features you would need to


166
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,400
use it as a full-blown ide but is still


167
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,759
a great option available on most


168
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
machines to quickly edit a file from the


169
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
terminal at this point we've looked at


170
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
editors that mostly rely on a text user


171
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
interface but the majority of developers


172
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
today use editors that have a graphical


173
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
user interface one of the earliest


174
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
programs was notepad on windows which


175
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,919
came out in 1983. in fact the program


176
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,759
itself was designed to commercialize the


177
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,320
mouse for ms-dos a more modern version


178
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
for programmers is notepad plus plus


179
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
instead of using the keyboard to place


180
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
the cursor where you want to edit you


181
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,919
simply click there with the mouse or if


182
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
you want to highlight you click hold and


183
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
drag sounds obvious but in the early 80s


184
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,759
this was a feature that felt like going


185
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,840
into the metaverse today notepad plus


186
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
plus is not developed by microsoft but


187
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,199
it does feel very much like you're using


188
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,280
microsoft excel for writing code it


189
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
supports macros and plugins so you can


190
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
definitely use it as your primary


191
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,319
development environment next up we've


192
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,319
got a proprietary ide that's very near


193
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,639
and dear to my heart adobe dreamweaver i


194
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,160
haven't actually used it in years but


195
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
it's the tool that got me started in web


196
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
development it used to be extremely


197
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,520
popular but not so much anymore today


198
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
it's actually a very beautiful tool and


199
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
looks really nice while you're editing


200
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
code but at the same time feels overly


201
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
slow and complex like pretty much all


202
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
adobe software it's also pretty


203
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
antiquated with first class support for


204
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
jquery and bootstrap that's pretty sad


205
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
for a commercial product and if you're


206
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
paying to use dreamweaver in 2022 stop


207
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,080
it


208
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,280
get some help


209
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
mcdonald's wants you to give yourself a


210
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
chance there are far superior free


211
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
options in the modern world you've got


212
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
tools like sublime text brackets atom


213
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
which was killed recently


214
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
but the most popular lightweight editor


215
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,840
by far is visual studio code it has a


216
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,599
graphical user interface making it very


217
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,440
approachable for beginners but also has


218
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
a ton of built-in shortcuts that allow


219
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,479
you to do things quickly kind of like


220
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
text-based editors i actually have a


221
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
full course on fireship i o that breaks


222
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
down all my favorite techniques for


223
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
increasing productivity with vs code you


224
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,039
can support my work by enrolling in that


225
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,120
course or upgrading to a pro membership


226
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,199
young people from all over the globe are


227
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,440
joining up to fight for the future i'm


228
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
doing my part but an even bigger benefit


229
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
of vs code is the fact that it's popular


230
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,919
and has a huge extension ecosystem that


231
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,120
means if you're using some kind of


232
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
tooling that can benefit from additional


233
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
support like tailwind for example you're


234
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,560
pretty much guaranteed to have a vs code


235
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,319
extension which may not be the case on


236
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
other editors the application itself is


237
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
open source and built with electron


238
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,520
which is based on web technologies


239
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,199
making it easy to extend for web


240
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,479
developers although it does have a


241
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,160
reputation of being a memory hog the


242
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
editing experience can be very minimal


243
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
if you'd like and i usually go into zen


244
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,039
mode when writing code myself but at the


245
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,800
same time you can make it a full-blown


246
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
integrated development environment it


247
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
can edit files remotely on github


248
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,440
connect to your resources in the cloud


249
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
work with docker containers and so on


250
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
that's great and all but for many


251
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
platforms vs code may not be the optimal


252
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
choice if you're building ios apps


253
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
you'll likely want to use apple's


254
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
integrated development environment xcode


255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,080
or for android apps google's android


256
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
studio or as we'll look at now visual


257
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
studio for microsoft's.net framework


258
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
this is a true integrated development


259
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
environment which is a comprehensive set


260
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
of tools for developing certain types of


261
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
apps like in this case desktop web and


262
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
server-side apps with dot-net it


263
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,080
provides powerful code completion


264
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
refactoring and debugging tools for its


265
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
core languages like c-plus plus and


266
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
c-sharp it may feel overwhelming at


267
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
first because there's all kinds of tools


268
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,120
and wizards that you're not going to


269
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,879
know how to use until you're balls deep


270
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,240
in a project when you get that deep


271
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,759
you'll be really glad to have tools like


272
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
that because otherwise you'll likely be


273
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
dealing with some half-assed open source


274
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,800
extension if you're lucky the bottom


275
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,880
line is that ides can be awesome when


276
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
you're committed to a specific platform


277
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
and that brings us to number 10


278
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,800
jetbrains a family of editors and ides


279
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,399
that many consider the gold standard for


280
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
writing code at a professional level


281
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
it's most well known for intellij for


282
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,680
java development but in this video we'll


283
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
look at webstorm for web development


284
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
although i use vs code today i've been a


285
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
happy jetbrains customer in the past but


286
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,959
that happiness comes at a cost of about


287
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,200
69 per year you can evaluate it with a


288
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
free trial and when you first open up


289
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
webstorm you'll notice things feel more


290
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
like a true ide as opposed to a minimal


291
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
text editor it has a wizard to guide you


292
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,399
through the setup of a new project


293
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,000
although this does feel pretty outdated


294
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
with options like meteor cordova and


295
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
angularjs version 1 which was retired a


296
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
few months ago if you're still using


297
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
angularjs version 1 you're only cheating


298
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
yourself out of the chance to find out


299
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
who you really can be once you're in the


300
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,519
project you should have pretty much


301
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
everything you need to hit the ground


302
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
running there's less of a need to


303
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
install a bunch of plugins one thing i


304
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
really appreciate about webstorm is its


305
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,839
code refactoring for example in a react


306
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,839
app we can click on a ui element and


307
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
easily extract it into its own named


308
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
component we can also do that in vs code


309
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
with extensions but it just feels way


310
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
more reliable in webstorm in webstorm


311
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,200
most of the features feel a little more


312
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
polished and reliable which is what you


313
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
would expect from a paid product what's


314
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
also interesting is that jetbrains is


315
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,160
coming out with a new editor called


316
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,440
fleet which will be more like a


317
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
competitor to vs code currently it's on


318
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
a close preview so i haven't been able


319
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
to try it but make sure you're


320
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,440
subscribed because as soon as it comes


321
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,200
out i'll drop a video we just looked at


322
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
10 different ways to edit code on your


323
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
machine but i want to finish up by


324
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
saying that we're entering an age where


325
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
code editors may become entirely


326
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
cloud-based like you can run vs code in


327
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
your browser right now by going to


328
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
vscode.dev then you've got github code


329
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
spaces where you can edit your code on


330
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
overpowered cloud hardware then you've


331
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,320
got tools like stack blitz that use


332
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
webassembly to run full stack web


333
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,920
applications in the browser the future


334
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,600
looks interesting but the most important


335
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
takeaway from this video is don't do


336
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,839
drugs thanks for watching and i will see


337
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,480
you in the next one
