1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,960
web graphics library is a javascript api


2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,000
for implementing


3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,480
interactive 2d and 3d vector graphics in


4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,200
the browser


5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,040
it allows developers to run hardware


6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,719
accelerated graphics with the client's


7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,440
gpu


8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,679
directly inside an html canvas without


9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,679
the need for external plugins it opens


10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,359
the door to 3d web design


11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,520
interactive games data vis physics


12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,439
simulations and most importantly


13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,560
beautiful artwork


14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,560
webgl is used to render graphics in


15
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,480
everyday tools like google maps and by


16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,880
the unity engine to make web-based games


17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
to understand how it works it helps to


18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
first understand basic 3d theory


19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
and the rendering pipeline in a 3d scene


20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,800
every point is a vertex


21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
identified by its x y and z coordinates


22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
the vertices are then connected together


23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
to form a bunch of little triangles


24
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
known as primitives


25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
then a light source bounces off of them


26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
to create the appearance of shadows and


27
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
depth perception they're then rasterized


28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,719
to convert


29
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,280
a 3d vector graphic into a projection of


30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,320
a 2d pixel


31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,559
which tricks our brains into seeing a 3d


32
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,320
object on a 2-dimensional computer


33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,800
screen


34
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,399
this pipeline can be customized by


35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
writing shaders which are just functions


36
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,000
that tell the computer how to draw


37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
pixels on the screen


38
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
shading requires the computer to perform


39
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,439
a ton of linear algebra or matrix


40
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,320
multiplication


41
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,119
to render graphics smoothly at 60fps


42
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,960
it's often too much for the cpu to


43
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
handle by itself which is why we have


44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,880
gpus to distribute the calculations more


45
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,159
efficiently webgl


46
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
allows us to process graphics on the gpu


47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
and is based on a library that's been


48
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
around since 1992 called opengl


49
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
to get started you just need to grab an


50
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,560
html canvas in the dom


51
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
then get its webgl contacts to start


52
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
drawing the main program code is written


53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,680
in javascript


54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
but shaders are written in the opengl es


55
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,360
shading language


56
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
a shader will take information about a


57
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,680
vertex or fragment and use the gpu to


58
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
calculate the data required to render it


59
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
as a pixel on the screen


60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
luckily you don't need to write shaders


61
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,119
by hand to start adding 3d graphics to


62
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
your website you can use libraries like


63
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,439
3js or tools like spline to quickly


64
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,439
design 3d experiences without much


65
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,280
underlying knowledge of webgl


66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
