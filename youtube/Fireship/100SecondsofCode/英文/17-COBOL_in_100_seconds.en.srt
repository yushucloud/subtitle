1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
common business oriented language or


2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,780
COBOL is a weak verbose and flabby


3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,580
language used by coat grinders to do


4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,919
boring things on dinosaur mainframes it


5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,530
was developed over 100 years ago in 1959


6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,750
but is still in demand today in 2020


7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,340
because it's the language used on many


8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,199
mainframe computer systems you know


9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,150
those things we call big iron usually


10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,100
built by IBM to handle massive amounts


11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,510
of throughput to handle things like


12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,130
credit card transactions airline


13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,109
ticketing and most recently the massive


14
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,090
spike in unemployment claims so if you


15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,010
want to be a programmer in 2020 COBOL


16
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,449
might be your best bet it's a high-level


17
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,189
imperative language which means it's


18
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,020
very easy to learn the syntax is


19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,850
extremely verbose by design because it's


20
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,710
self documenting and it contains over


21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,570
600 reserved words for you to memorize


22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,730
to take advantage of and every COBOL


23
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,200
program is structured with an


24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,940
easy-to-follow hierarchy your program


25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,530
contains many divisions which contain


26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,879
many sections which contain many


27
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,530
paragraphs which contain many sentences


28
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,329
that contain your statements which of


29
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:52,949
course contain many characters when you


30
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,360
start writing some COBOL code you'll


31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,920
notice these vertical lines in your IDE


32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,660
the first six characters are your line


33
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,430
numbers start at zero zero zero one


34
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,410
hundred and increment by 100 for each


35
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,969
line column seven is where you identify


36
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,979
comments or the continuation of a


37
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,960
previous line if we're identifying a new


38
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
division section or paragraph we can use


39
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
columns 8 through 11 and notice how


40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,180
every line ends with a period that's


41
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,830
what's known as readable code now


42
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,750
columns 12 through 72 are where you


43
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,430
write your actual statements the reason


44
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,020
you don't go beyond 72 columns is


45
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,670
because your code needs to fit onto a


46
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,470
physical punch card and it ensures your


47
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,479
program is responsive on mobile devices


48
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,310
we can define our variables in the data


49
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,320
division first we name the variable then


50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,939
we define its data type with the picture


51
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,979
keyword then assign a value to it we can


52
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,060
then work with this data in the


53
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,470
procedure division we display the


54
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,150
variable then tell our program to stop


55
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,680
from there we can pile our program to a


56
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
binary run it and everything should work


57
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,700
perfectly and now you're qualified for a


58
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,200
six-figure salary maintaining the


59
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,939
world's most critical legacy systems


60
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,430
this has been COBOL in 100 seconds hit

watching and I will see you in the next

one oh hey there thanks for sticking


65
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,740
around this is the part of the video


66
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,509
where we go beyond 100 seconds to


67
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,829
learned some more advanced features of


68
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,189
COBOL
