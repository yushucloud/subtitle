1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,199
content platforms treat the content on


2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,120
your website or app like data in the


3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,359
beginning we had html websites where


4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,040
content was embedded directly in the


5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,960
code but that was never going to scale


6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,799
well the next generation of websites


7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,599
used a content management system or cms


8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,760
where content is stored in a database


9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
then injected into an html template this


10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
works great until you decide you want to


11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
migrate your app into a fancy new


12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
javascript framework or maybe you want


13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,480
to display the same content on ios palm


14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
os and android or you may just have


15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,160
multiple views for the same content


16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,920
within a single application these


17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,399
demands gave rise to the headless cms a


18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
tool that turns your content into a


19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,399
cloud-based api so it can be accessed


20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
from any application today a content


21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,480
platform is a critical layer of the


22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,399
modern tech stack where it serves as a


23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
single source of truth for your brand


24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,840
and because it's completely decoupled


25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
from your application code and user


26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,199
database you can take it with you


27
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,960
anywhere in addition it gives you the


28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
ability to model and custom tailor your


29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
content for any situation rather than


30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,199
start from a cookie cutter solution you


31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
can build your own schema with different


32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
fields for things like text and images


33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,119
and create relationships between items


34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
like you might in a relational database


35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
it's a win for marketers because they


36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,479
have a single polished interface for


37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
managing content but it's an even bigger


38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
win for us developers because we can now


39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
query content from any code base in a


40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
consistent and structured way one tool


41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,960
that makes that possible is sanity a


42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,799
popular choice for jam stack


43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,200
applications which stands for javascript


44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,479
apis and markup sanity is part of the a


45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,240
and the jam stack it provides an open


46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
source studio where you can model your


47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
content with javascript and manage it in


48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,560
the browser meanwhile the actual data is


49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
stored in the cloud in what's known as a


50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
content lake which can then be queried


51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
from a friend application quickly with


52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
its built-in ctn while supporting


53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
features like graphql web hooks and


54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
real-time updates this has been content


55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,439
platforms in 100 seconds but stay tuned


56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,119
because today i've invited cap from


57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,600
sanity to take us beyond 100 seconds and


58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
show us exactly how a content platform


59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,759
can fit into our tech stack


60
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
thank you so much for that intro aloha


61
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
everyone my name is cap and i do


62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,840
developer relations at


63
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,599
sanity.io so sanity is a platform for


64
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,560
structured content as a content platform


65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
sanity helps you manage and deliver your


66
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
content in ways you may have not thought


67
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
possible if you're thinking of adding a


68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,560
content platform to your project look no


69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,720
further than this fully customizable


70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
sanity project product i'm about to show


71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,040
you so content can be a lot of different


72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
things it can be


73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
the content for a blog or a portfolio it


74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
could be the video content on a course


75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,160
platform it could be the menu and the


76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
hours and the address of a restaurant


77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
it could be a car manufacturer's content


78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,879
and the number of cars that were made in


79
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,519
a quarter how many were sent out and how


80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,879
many were purchased


81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,239
it could be the music tracks for a


82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
singer and they're trying to get their


83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
name out in the world so they want to


84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
save it all in one spot


85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,879
it could be the times and winners for


86
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,239
each sporting event and a major


87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,400
tournament you get the picture content


88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
is everywhere and we can find it all


89
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
online within a couple of seconds


90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,480
so with most projects


91
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
content is going to be present it's best


92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
to manage it and know where content is


93
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
going from the beginning incorporating a


94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,879
content platform saves you time in the


95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,720
long run


96
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,239
but there are many other benefits too


97
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
and let me tell you about those so a


98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
content platform should allow you


99
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,239
freedom with your content one of the


100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,159
biggest reasons why most developers or


101
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
content creators hesitate to incorporate


102
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
a content platform is that there's this


103
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,879
fear of losing true ownership to your


104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,560
content to your stuff


105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
a content platform should not steal


106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
ownership it should allow you to own it


107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
of course it's yours it should allow you


108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
to deliver your content however and


109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
wherever you need it to go it should


110
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
also allow you to structure and manage


111
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,159
it however it best fits your needs


112
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
so let me show you how with sanity you


113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,159
can accomplish all of those things


114
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,720
built with react there is a sanity.io


115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,760
backend ui for the content called sanity


116
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,959
studio the studio is fully customizable


117
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
you structure your content or your data


118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
however you need and because it's built


119
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,319
with react if you know react you can


120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
code it up to be however you want it to


121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
look


122
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
and then there's a nifty thing called


123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,680
portable text portable text is storing


124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
your rich text in json format


125
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
that json format can be reused


126
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
everywhere


127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
mobile desktop a different front end etc


128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
more on that in a little


129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
so we should be treating our content as


130
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,960
data and because our content is data we


131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
want to treat it as such so wherever you


132
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
need your data to go or do with sanity


133
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
the possibilities are nearly endless


134
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
using sanity allows for full


135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
customization of how your structure


136
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
content looks for editors developers


137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
anyone manipulating the content


138
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
it also allows for the ability to


139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
reshape and present your content in any


140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
format


141
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
so using sanity and the content like you


142
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,400
now have a real-time database that gives


143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,479
you access to your content however and


144
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,000
wherever you need


145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,199
you know how


146
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
you redesign your website every couple


147
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
of months just because


148
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,560
or you want to try that new framework


149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
with structured content you can redesign


150
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,160
you can try a new framework at any time


151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,240
so go ahead use that new javascript


152
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
framework and continue using your


153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
content like you've been doing


154
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
so let me show you how with sanity.io to


155
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
get a project up and running in just a


156
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
few minutes remember what i show you


157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
today can be used on any front end i'll


158
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
show you how to spin up a project and


159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
also a couple other cool things to get


160
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,960
you going right out of the box so let's


161
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
go ahead and let's structure our content


162
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,199
all right so to get started go to


163
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,960
sanity.io here we're going to find these


164
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
two buttons get started get started


165
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,440
click on either one of these


166
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
so once we click on that we'll see


167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,639
official starters you can choose one of


168
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,960
these but we're actually going to do


169
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
this npm install so we're going to be


170
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,039
installing globally this sanity cli and


171
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,400
we're going to be running the command


172
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
sanity init that will start our very own


173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
sanity project so what i did is i copied


174
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,360
that command


175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
and


176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
i now went to my terminal and in my


177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
terminal i'm going to paste that command


178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,120
in


179
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
hit enter and then it will install the


180
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
cli for me and it will initialize a


181
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
brand new project


182
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,280
if you have not logged in using sanity


183
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
on your local computer you will be


184
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,680
prompted you may be prompted to log in


185
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
using either google github or email


186
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
password choose one of those remember


187
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,319
what you choose because we're going to


188
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,840
need that in the future


189
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,759
so i'm going to create new project i'll


190
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,880
hit enter


191
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
and we're going to name our project so


192
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,759
this is whatever you want it to be named


193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,360
whatever you want your sanity project to


194
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
be named i'm going to name it fireship


195
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
so i'm going to hit enter


196
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
and then we are going to be asked about


197
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
the data set so we are going to be using


198
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,919
the default data set so i'm just going


199
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,639
to hit y for yes it will be called


200
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
production so we're going to want that


201
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
is that path correct it is so i'm going


202
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,240
to hit enter


203
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,319
now we can choose from movie e-commerce


204
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
blog or clean project


205
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
we are going to do blog for this one the


206
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,479
other ones have like


207
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
uh so they'll have like pre-built


208
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,240
schemas


209
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
with um some data in it the blog one is


210
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
a pre-built schema with no data in it


211
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,880
and then the clean one of course has


212
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
nothing so you would just build your own


213
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,080
schemas out


214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
with this one we don't want any


215
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
pre-built data we just want pre-built


216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
schemas


217
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,520
and it is done all right so we're going


218
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
to cd into our project


219
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
and now we are in it we can run other


220
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
either sanity docs manage help any of


221
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,199
those but we actually want to open this


222
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
up in our text editor of choice so i'm


223
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,599
going to actually open it in vs code


224
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,919
there's a shortcut that i have installed


225
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
code space period if you have that use


226
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
that if not go to your vs code or text


227
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,840
editor and open yours up


228
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
now i'm going to make this big


229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
all right so let's go through a little


230
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,800
bit of this file structure so the


231
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,639
sanity.json if we go here we actually


232
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,120
can find our project id and the name of


233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
it so we named it fireship


234
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,319
we have that


235
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,039
this project id is what you will need


236
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
if you need something else to speak to


237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,639
your content link so say you have your


238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,160
react front end


239
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
or your next js front end and you want


240
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
it to speak to this


241
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
data set then you will need this project


242
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,120
id so that is an easy way to find it now


243
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,639
i also want to point out the schemas


244
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,680
folder in here if we did the clean


245
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
project when we were


246
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,959
answering those questions this would


247
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,640
pretty much be empty just a couple


248
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,959
things would be in here but like author


249
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,000
category post those would not be here


250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,640
now if we went to schema.js


251
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
here's where we import and use all of


252
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,680
our different schema files


253
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
so we have block content category post


254
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
author that also matches up with all


255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,519
these over here and then down here


256
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
is when we use it


257
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,040
so we import it and then use it


258
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
if you make a new file make sure you


259
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,120
come in here and import and use


260
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
now i'm going to go to post


261
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
this is our document type now sanity


262
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
uses schema types and in schema types


263
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
document is one of them there's also


264
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,399
string


265
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,680
slug


266
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
reference image and we'll go through a


267
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
couple of these and i'll show you what


268
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
they look like


269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
this one is a our document type post and


270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,519
it has an array


271
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,720
of fields so there's title there's slug


272
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
but let me actually just show you what


273
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,560
this looks like on the browser side on


274
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
the sanity studio


275
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,640
front-end side the ui side of it so i'm


276
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,519
going to open up my uh terminal


277
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
i used ctrl tilde to open it up within


278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
vs code you can open it up however you


279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
want and i'm going to run the command


280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,959
sanity start so run that command hit


281
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,399
enter


282
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
and it's starting up our studio


283
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
and it will live at localhost 3333 so


284
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,440
it's ready let's go back to our browser


285
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
localhost 3333


286
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
and here remember whatever you chose


287
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
when you did the login at the beginning


288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
choose here


289
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
so i'm going to do google


290
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
and


291
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,120
i am now authorized so because it is


292
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,519
mine i have authorization to it


293
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,279
if you want to give someone else


294
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,560
authorization to it go to


295
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
manage.sanity.io


296
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
and you can add more users


297
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
so this is what our studio looks like it


298
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
has the name you can search through your


299
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
content desk vision we'll get to the


300
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
vision plugin in a little bit but here


301
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
are our three document types so post


302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,120
nothing let's actually add a new post


303
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
so


304
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
let's do my first blog post


305
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
we will generate a slug


306
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,959
author


307
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,320
is


308
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,640
let me pull this down


309
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
author is a


310
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,920
reference


311
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,839
it's referencing


312
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,880
this author document so before we


313
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
actually


314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,079
can see anything in this drop down we


315
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,320
need to go make an author so we can


316
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
leave all this here i'm gonna go back to


317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
content click on author and let's make


318
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,560
sure i'm gonna click on this little


319
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680
pencil


320
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,200
i'm going to make a new author we'll


321
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
just do my name


322
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
generate


323
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,640
and


324
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,320
i


325
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,000
am cap


326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
and then publish that


327
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
awesome so now that's published let's go


328
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
back to our post


329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
back to the one that we were working on


330
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
and if i do the drop down we now see


331
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
that author i just made if we had a


332
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
picture if i had added a picture to that


333
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,519
this would be the little thumbnail of


334
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,279
that picture


335
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
then we have main image


336
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
and let's add a main image then we have


337
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
categories publish that and body


338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
so with main image let me actually make


339
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
this just a little bit smaller


340
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
main image there are three ways


341
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
to upload a main image you can click on


342
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,680
upload and it will bring down the file


343
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
structure like the files from your own


344
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
computer you can drop in an image so


345
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
just like drag and drop or you can paste


346
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
in an image and we're going to do that


347
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
so i'm going to go to unsplash


348
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,000
and let's look up


349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,040
cats


350
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
we'll do this cat with the butterfly so


351
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,040
we're going to copy image


352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,959
go back here and i'm going to do command


353
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,519
v to paste it in and now we have


354
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,480
our cat and butterfly image


355
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
and


356
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,519
there we go now let me show you a really


357
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,279
cool thing about


358
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,920
sanity and images so i just unzoom this


359
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,240
a little bit more because i need to show


360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
you everything that's going on


361
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
but if i click on edit details


362
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
in here


363
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
i have


364
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
some views of my image


365
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
so this is a really cool thing about


366
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
sanity is i upload once and it will work


367
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,279
for all these aspect ratios


368
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,800
i can crop here and this is the crop


369
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
and i can do hotspot


370
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
hot spot is making sure let me actually


371
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,160
show you the thumbnail as i'm doing it


372
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,320
so hot spot is making sure that whatever


373
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
is in this hot spot is always in view no


374
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,519
matter what type of aspect ratio my


375
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,320
image is so if i want to make sure that


376
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,760
the cat's


377
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
ear is always in view notice how the


378
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
panorama changed


379
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,959
or if i want the cat's nose always in


380
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,880
view notice how it's changing


381
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
so i don't have to do


382
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
um like multiple uploads to make sure


383
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
that my that my crop is good that my hot


384
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,920
spot's always on


385
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
sanity will make sure that this spot


386
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
that your hot spot is on is always in


387
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,320
view


388
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,639
and that's how that works


389
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,800
so then you just exit out and there's my


390
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,519
hot spot and crop for my image


391
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,000
so here is the body of my first blog


392
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
post


393
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,959
now


394
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
this is the rich text editor and in here


395
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
we'll live our portable text


396
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,279
here is


397
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,760
the body of my blog


398
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
post


399
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,519
i hope you like it old-fashioned smiley


400
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,399
face


401
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,120
and so here is our portable text


402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
portable text will live in this rich


403
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
text editor and


404
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
this is the sanity way of storing our


405
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
rich text


406
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
so you know how when you get html and


407
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
you want to put it into react


408
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,120
application


409
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,040
it kind of


410
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
isn't very intuitive because you have to


411
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,760
do


412
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,839
the dangerously set prop and then you


413
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,320
kind of lose control of it so because


414
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
portable text is data it becomes json


415
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
and so you can actually put it into your


416
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
react application it makes it more


417
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,199
intuitive as you pass it along to


418
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,839
mobile to desktop to


419
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,839
react to view


420
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,760
if you want to use a native app and


421
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
you're using html it would be harder


422
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,040
json


423
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
would make it easier and this is saved


424
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
as a json format


425
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,680
so this means that you can now query for


426
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
your content so say you wanted to find


427
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
out all the blog posts that had


428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
code blocks in it you can do that


429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
because all of this is stored as data


430
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
your content is your data and


431
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,160
that is portable text


432
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,560
now let me actually show you so here's


433
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
our first blog post let's publish it


434
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,079
let me actually show you


435
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,720
the inspect to our blog post if you


436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
click on those three dots click on


437
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,399
inspect here is all of the json of our


438
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,120
blog post we have our main image we have


439
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,320
the title


440
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,160
we have all of our rich text


441
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,079
so that is how it looks that's how it's


442
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,279
sort and this is how we can query for it


443
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,959
things like this all right so let me


444
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
show you a really cool feature about


445
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,519
main image i know we already had hotspot


446
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,639
on crop


447
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,560
but let me show you another thing so if


448
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,800
i go to my vision plugin wait before i


449
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
do that i actually have to go to the


450
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
three dots


451
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,079
inspect


452
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,959
and i need to find my main image


453
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,880
reference


454
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
this is the id to my image so i'm going


455
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,639
to copy that


456
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,399
so under my main image the asset ref


457
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
i'm going to come to my vision plugin


458
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
now the vision plug-in this is where we


459
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
can query for our own content


460
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
we're going to use grok today


461
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
you can use either graphql or grok with


462
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,639
sanity grok is an in-house sanity made


463
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
query language and i will show you how


464
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,480
it's done just a little bit there are


465
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,600
definitely more places that you can


466
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,120
learn about grok


467
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,600
but yeah let me start off


468
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
so by doing the asterisk i am grabbing


469
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
all of my content link i'm going to do


470
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,399
the square brackets to filter down so


471
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,240
i'm going to do underscore id is equal


472
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
to and i'm going to paste in the id that


473
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
i grabbed from the image


474
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
okay i'm going to run that query and in


475
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
here this is all of the content we get


476
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,279
back from that image so create it at


477
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,360
the id of it the id will match what we


478
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,959
just had over here


479
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,399
the type


480
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,000
but i really want to point this part out


481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
so under the metadata we get dimensions


482
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
but we also get the palette


483
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,199
this palette is pretty awesome in here


484
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,199
we get our


485
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
dark muted dark vibrant light vibrant


486
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,199
muted all the colors that are part of


487
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,360
this image and a


488
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,839
optimal foreground color for it


489
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
so dark vibrant


490
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,039
takes up 1.93 of the image


491
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,799
this is the color and this would be a


492
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,799
good foreground color for it so if you


493
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,840
put text over this part of the image


494
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,880
it would be really great for


495
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
accessibility this color for the text


496
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,679
let's look at


497
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,200
light vibrant


498
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,880
so it takes up that much of the image


499
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
this is the color and this would be a


500
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,480
good foreground color so that's just a


501
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
really awesome thing to


502
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
to note


503
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
that you can have that you have this at


504
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
your fingertips with all the images so


505
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
you can find that go to your vision plug


506
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,120
plugin query for that id and you have


507
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,679
all this at your fingertips so really


508
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,080
great


509
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
okay so let's actually add a couple


510
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,240
things to our studio so we have what it


511
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,559
comes with but let's add a couple things


512
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
so i'm going to go back to my code


513
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,559
and under title within the post.js file


514
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
in the schemas folder let's go


515
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,160
underneath here and type in description


516
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
and we'll do


517
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,360
keep titles


518
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
short and sweet


519
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,919
let's do a smiley face


520
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,520
save that


521
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
and if we go back


522
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
keep titles short and sweet so it's just


523
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,400
a quick little description that you can


524
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,360
have


525
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,720
and you can start customizing your


526
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,000
studio


527
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
but let's create a whole new schema type


528
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,679
so if we go to


529
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,480
the schema types in the docs for sanity


530
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,840
we will find


531
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
an entire list of all of the schema


532
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,679
types that we can use


533
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,919
so we've been working in document


534
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,000
we've done the string we have done image


535
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
let's


536
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
add a number


537
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,320
so if we go to number is what it will


538
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
look like


539
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
and there's the properties there's


540
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,320
options


541
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,480
and then invalidation


542
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,559
but here's what we need for our schema


543
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,720
so i'm going to copy that


544
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
take it over


545
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,600
let's do it right after this


546
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
the slug


547
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
add a comma to separate those objects


548
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
and let's change the title so we just


549
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
need the title name and type


550
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
for our


551
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,720
new schema type so title will do time


552
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
time to read


553
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,679
that is the title that will live within


554
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
our studio so this is the title this is


555
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
the title


556
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,000
the name is the name of the field


557
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,679
time to read


558
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
type will keep as number i'm going to


559
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
save that


560
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
come back here and now we have


561
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
a brand new time to read notice how


562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,480
these little arrows come up i could add


563
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,840
that way


564
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
or i could edit


565
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
this way so let's actually add a


566
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
validation let's make sure that you


567
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,919
can't do longer than


568
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,559
20 minutes time to read okay


569
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,480
so i'm going to come up here and these


570
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,600
are all the different types of


571
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
validations we can do required min


572
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,760
number less than


573
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,159
let's learn more about validation and if


574
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,679
we come down here


575
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
we want this line so validation and i'll


576
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,840
actually just go just to required


577
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,679
because we want required


578
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,520
i'm going to copy that line


579
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
go back to my number


580
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
and paste that in


581
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,560
and then let's also add the less than


582
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
[Music]


583
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,280
20.


584
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,320
so


585
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,159
no matter what we can't make the number


586
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,760
go above 20 otherwise we'll get a


587
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,360
warning


588
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
come back here and last number we put in


589
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
was 88 and sure enough


590
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,039
it's giving us an error must be less


591
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,520
than 20. so no matter what if we just


592
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
keep going down


593
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
until we get it below 20


594
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
it's not gonna be happy with this 19


595
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,440
and if i go up error again so if you


596
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
want 20 to be included


597
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,559
then we would change this to 21


598
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,840
and we don't get the error but the


599
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,760
moment we go go up we get that error


600
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,799
again so that is a validation rule to


601
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
make sure that it stays within the


602
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,080
numbers that you want


603
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,360
all right so now that that's all done


604
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
let's publish that


605
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
and let's get our


606
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,080
sanity studio deployed


607
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
so what we need to do is we need to go


608
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,000
back to our code


609
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
and in here i'm going to keep this


610
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
i'm going to create a new one and we


611
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,559
need to run the command sanity deploy


612
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
hit enter


613
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,799
now studio host name this is now unique


614
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,520
so


615
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
when you created the project with me you


616
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,480
could have used the name fireship


617
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
alongside me because that's local but


618
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,159
this one is unique i am going to use the


619
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,120
name fireship see if that's available


620
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,480
and it looks like it


621
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,360
is


622
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
because it's not giving me an error so


623
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,080
now fire ship is now taken so you can't


624
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
use that and by the time you're watching


625
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,520
this maybe fire ship one and fire ship


626
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,840
two are also taken so it has to be


627
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,960
unique


628
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
and once it is done my studio will now


629
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,240
live at fireship.sanity.studio


630
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,799
and i will have i will have


631
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,880
authorization to view it and anyone else


632
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
i give authorization can view it so


633
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,720
there's my new url


634
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,440
come back here fireship.sanity.studio


635
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,360
and here is


636
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
my


637
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
newly deployed


638
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
studio with all my stuff first blog post


639
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
everything that i have now let me show


640
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,919
you a really cool thing i'm gonna


641
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,640
shrink this a little bit


642
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,120
pull this one out


643
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,360
and now i have my local one version my


644
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,000
local version running and i have my


645
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
deployed version running


646
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,159
now these two


647
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,280
are the same studio


648
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
but watch this


649
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
so anything i do in my local version


650
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
shows up in my


651
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
deployed version anything i do in my


652
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
deployed version shows up in my local


653
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,280
version


654
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
and if i do anything


655
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
you can see these little pencils show up


656
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
on both sides if i click on that little


657
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,360
pencil it will show what has happened


658
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
and we can see who made that change and


659
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,960
if i come over here


660
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
click on review changes


661
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,919
we can revert that change from either


662
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,280
side


663
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,880
revert that change we don't want it and


664
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
it disappears


665
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,000
so that is live preview insanity to see


666
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,799
both the local side and the deployed


667
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,440
side working together live


668
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
and if i publish


669
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,520
will be published on both sides and


670
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
yeah


671
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
and that is how you build your first


672
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,559
project with sanity.io


673
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,240
all right so we have our own content


674
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,760
like up and running that we can query


675
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,000
against we have the json for all of our


676
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,520
content and the content can be used


677
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,440
across all platforms we're not limited


678
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,520
to anything so thank you so much for


679
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
watching if you have more questions


680
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
