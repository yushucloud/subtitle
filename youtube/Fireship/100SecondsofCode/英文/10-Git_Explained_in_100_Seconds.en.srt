1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
get a system for keeping track of


2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,870
changes that happen across a set of


3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,580
files open a directory on your local


4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,710
system with an editor like vs code then


5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,660
run get an it from the command line you


6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,210
just created a git repository or repo it


7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,950
lives in this hidden get directory and


8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,420
keeps track of all the changes that


9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,250
happen to these files as you work on a


10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,289
codebase you take snapshots or commits


11
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,760
of the current state of these files


12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,769
every commit has a unique ID and is


13
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,390
linked to its parent and this means we


14
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,160
can travel back in time to a previous


15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,810
version of our files notice how our


16
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,849
source control icon is lit up currently


17
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,619
all of our files are untracked because


18
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,809
we need to add them to the repo run get


19
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,880
add to include or stage these files in


20
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,770
the repo then create a snapshot of their


21
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,420
current state by running git commit


22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,219
along with a message about what you did


23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,050
to these files congratulations


24
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,430
you just created the first commit on the


25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,320
head of the master branch in this repo


26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,149
the changed files disappeared and you're


27
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,920
now on a clean working directory the


28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,539
head represents the most recent commit


29
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,489
if we make some changes commit them to


30
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,530
the repo the head moves forward but we


31
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,879
still have a reference to our previous


32
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,590
commits so we can always go back to it


33
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,149
but the thing about software is that


34
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,649
it's developed in a nonlinear fashion


35
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,899
you might have multiple teams working on


36
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,549
different features for the same codebase


37
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,130
simultaneously it makes that possible by


38
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,110
branching create one by running git


39
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,090
branch and then rank it check out to


40
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,920
move into that branch you can now safely


41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,450
work on your feature in this branch


42
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,640
without affecting the code or files in


43
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,170
the master branch the commits you make


44
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,880
here live in an alternate universe with


45
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,619
its own unique history at some point


46
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,119
though you'll likely want to merge this


47
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,710
history with the history and the master


48
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,540
branch when you're ready go back to the


49
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,920
master branch by running git checkout


50
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,600
then run git merge on your


51
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,380
alternate-universe


52
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,270
the tip of your feature branch now


53
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,770
becomes the head of the master branch


54
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,630
where in other words our fragmented


55
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,210
universe has become one unless he ran


56
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,979
into a merge conflict in which case


57
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,509
you'll just have to wait for the sequel


58
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,670
this has been get explained in 100


59
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,259
