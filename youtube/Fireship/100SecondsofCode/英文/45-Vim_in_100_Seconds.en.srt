1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,240
them a text editor for writing code


2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,520
where you navigate around the screen


3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,600
with a keyboard instead of a mouse it's


4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,759
based on the original unix text editor


5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,519
vi which came about in 1976 then vi


6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
improved or vim followed it in 1991 with


7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,640
a bunch of improvements but why in the


8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,800
age of modern ides would you ever want


9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,039
to use a keyboard-based text editor when


10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,800
you write code all day every day your


11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
fingers should be glued to the keyboard


12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,160
at all times every time you touch the


13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
mouse your productivity declines


14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,599
learning to code with them is like


15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,199
learning to play an instrument it'll be


16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,360
painful at first but that pain will lead


17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,120
to more precise and productive code


18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
editing in the future them runs in the


19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,879
terminal and it's installed on almost


20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,559
every machine and at some point you'll


21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,000
likely find yourself accidentally


22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,200
dropped into them with no way to escape


23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
if you find yourself there you can quit


24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,960
them by typing colonqueue that will


25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
close an unmodified file or if it has


26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,120
been modified you can use cubebang to


27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,239
throw away your changes or wq to write


28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
the changes and then quit now that we're


29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
out let's use them to open up a file


30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
currently we're in normal mode but we


31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
can toggle between different modes like


32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
insert visual and command line depending


33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,799
on what we're trying to do we can move


34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,560
around the text with the arrow keys or


35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
the letters h j k l if we find a


36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,960
character we want to delete we can hit x


37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
or double d to quickly delete an entire


38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,080
line if that was a mistake hit u to undo


39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
it now currently the document is kind of


40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
hard to read so let's add line numbers


41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,000
by running colon set number and now we


42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
can navigate to any line with colon


43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
number now if we want to change some


44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,600
text we need to go into insert mode by


45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
hitting i and that frees up the keyboard


46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
for us to type into the document once


47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,439
we're done modifying our code we can hit


48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
the escape key to go back to normal mode


49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
but now like any good developer we need


50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,759
to copy and paste some code in here from


51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
stack overflow we can paste from the


52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,079
system clipboard by entering plus p into


53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,600
vim and now that our software is


54
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
complete we can hit colon w to save it


55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
then run the program directly from bim


56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
with colon bang followed by the shell


57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,320
command we want to run congratulations


58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
you're no longer a soy dev but a true


59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,479
software engineer this has been vim in


60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,880
100 seconds but stay tuned because you


61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,879
don't need to ditch vs code to get the


62
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,959
benefits of vim that's why i invited a


63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
true expert and the instructor of the


64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
vim for vs code course joe previt to


65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,959
take us beyond 100 seconds of them


66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,760
hello everyone i'm joe and i will be


67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,959
your guide as we go beyond 100 seconds


68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
to discuss why you should learn vim and


69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
how you can leverage it inside your


70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
favorite editor vs code first let's talk


71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
about why you should learn vim vim is an


72
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
evergreen skill meaning you can learn it


73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,200
once and the knowledge will last with


74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
you for the rest of your career it


75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
allows you to work faster and more


76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,959
efficiently within your editor here's a


77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,760
side-by-side comparison on the left we


78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,319
have editing with vim on the right we


79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
have editing without vim


80
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
as you can see bim lets you do more from


81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
the keyboard meaning you get to spend


82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,120
less time editing and more time coding


83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
now let's talk about how to set up vim


84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,440
with vs code once you're inside vs code


85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
head over to the extension panel


86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
and search vim


87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
you should see the first extension


88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
called vim and to make sure it's the


89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,239
right version double check that it's vs


90
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
code vim.vim and it should have around 2


91
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
million installations


92
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,720
go ahead and install this extension the


93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,159
next thing we're going to do is set up


94
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,360
key repeat


95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,239
so head over to google and look up vs


96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
code vim github you should see the first


97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
link which is a github repository called


98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
vs code vim vim


99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
there you're going to scroll down


100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
to the installation section


101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
in here


102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
you'll see instructions for how to


103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,000
enable key repeating


104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,879
this is a handy thing to add especially


105
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,799
when you're new to vim because it'll


106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
allow you to hit the key and it will


107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,879
repeat


108
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,640
as in if you were to hit


109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
j to move down


110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
find your operating system i'm on mac


111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
and then run this in your terminal


112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
and now for the changes to take effect


113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,519
you're going to want to restart vs code


114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
to verify that it worked go ahead and


115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
create a new file and now you should see


116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
that your cursor is a little bit wider


117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,440
go ahead and hit i this will put us in


118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
insert mode and then hit return a bunch


119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,639
of times


120
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,240
then hit escape


121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
and now try hitting and holding k and


122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
see if your cursor moves up


123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
if it moves like this


124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
pretty smooth then you've enabled key


125
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,240
repeating if it gets stuck then you may


126
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
want to try restarting vs code again or


127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
revisiting the installation instructions


128
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,600
great now that we have our editor set up


129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,680
i'd like to teach you a few different


130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
commands in vim so we'll review some of


131
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,440
the ones that jeff mentioned earlier in


132
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
the video and then we'll also learn a


133
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,919
few new ones so inside vs code go ahead


134
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,840
and create a new file and save it as


135
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,600
hello.md now what i want you to do is


136
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,680
hit i to enter insert mode and hit


137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,919
returns we add a few lines for us to


138
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,919
work with and then hit escape great so


139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,240
the first commands that we're going to


140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
talk about are for navigation and they


141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
will be h j k and l


142
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
so right now we're in command mode so if


143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,880
we hit k we'll start moving up if we hit


144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
j we'll move down


145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
so remember we just learned k for moving


146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
up i like to think of it as kicking a


147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
soccer ball up i'm kicking upwards on my


148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
editor and j for jumping down use


149
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
whatever mnemonic comes to mind to help


150
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,880
you remember those


151
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,240
the next we'll talk about are h and l so


152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,199
i'm going to write hello world here


153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,039
and you can do the same so


154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,440
again the way that i did that was i for


155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,039
insert mode start typing hello world and


156
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,199
then when you're done hit escape and


157
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
you'll be back in command mode so the


158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,600
first one we'll talk about is h so if


159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
you hit h you'll start moving to the


160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,479
left


161
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,919
as in you're moving to the beginning of


162
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,960
the line


163
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
also the h in hello world


164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
now once we're there if we want to go


165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
back right we start hitting l and that


166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,960
will move us towards the ellen world so


167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
again figure out a mnemonic that's going


168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
to help you remember those for me


169
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
i like to think of h as in i'm going


170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
home to the left


171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,560
and then l


172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,319
you would think that would be


173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,080
l for left but it's actually the


174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,039
opposite of that so l for right great so


175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,720
now we're feeling comfortable with


176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,039
navigating in vim again we're in command


177
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,240
mode we're moving up and down with j and


178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,960
k


179
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
and left and right with h and l the


180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,199
other thing to to remember is if you


181
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
take a look pause for a second look at


182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
your keyboard see where the keys are on


183
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
your keyboard you should see the h


184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
to the left of j and k so that also


185
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
helps me remember and then l


186
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
is to the right of j and k so it'll take


187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,759
some time but once you got those down


188
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,000
you'll be able to navigate seamlessly


189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,479
throughout your editor using vim so the


190
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
other thing i want to point out is you


191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
still have access to your mouse so you


192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
can click to move around


193
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
so there's no need to worry about


194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,759
getting stuck in vim i'm sure you've


195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,840
heard horror stories people not being


196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,639
able to exit them luckily using them


197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
inside of vs code we're really just


198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
using the them key bindings so we don't


199
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
have to worry we can close a file we can


200
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
navigate


201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
no need to to fear being stuck in vim


202
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,199
now the next thing i want to point out


203
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,759
is some editing commands so we will talk


204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,960
about i


205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
capital i


206
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
a


207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,560
and capital a for editing in a line so


208
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,919
we're going to go back to our hello


209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,160
world and you'll see right now the


210
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,639
cursor is at the end of the line if i


211
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,520
hit shift i or capital i it'll move me


212
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
in insert mode at the beginning so i


213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,120
could write a word like


214
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,160
i don't know


215
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
joe and then if i hit escape i'm back in


216
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,879
command mode where i can move around


217
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,080
so you'll notice


218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
the one thing that i want to point out


219
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
to a tip is a lot of vim users remap


220
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,599
their caps lock key to escape so instead


221
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,319
of


222
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,080
caps lock being caps lock when i hit the


223
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,879
key it actually is escape and so it's a


224
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,639
lot more accessible it's closer it's


225
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
right next to my pinky rather than


226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,240
having to reach to the corner of the


227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
keyboard and hit escape so that's one


228
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,800
thing i'd encourage you to look into


229
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,120
remapping your caps lock key to escape


230
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
if you're serious about learning vim so


231
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
we just covered capital i we know that


232
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,279
lowercase i


233
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
is insert mode right so now what i want


234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
to talk about is lowercase a the thing


235
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,680
that you got to pay attention to here is


236
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,959
the cursor


237
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,279
right now it's on top of the exclamation


238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,000
point so if i hit i it'll move to the


239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
left and now if i go back now if i hit a


240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
it'll enter into insert mode but after


241
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
the cursor


242
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,440
so like this


243
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
so again uh if we have like a number two


244
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
here and we want to add to the beginning


245
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
and make it 22 we'll hit i that'll let


246
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,519
us enter at the beginning and now if we


247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,760
want to add to the end like say i wanted


248
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,600
to add a


249
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
period 22 so 22 22 then i can use


250
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
lowercase a so those are very handy when


251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
you're inserting letters or making


252
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
changes


253
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,080
in a line now the next one that i want


254
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
to talk about is capital a and so this


255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
is like appending to the end of the line


256
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
so you'll enter insert mode at the end


257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
of a line so here i am and i want to add


258
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
more exclamation points at the end of


259
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
hello world so if i hit shift a it will


260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
move the cursor to the end and it will


261
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
enter into insert mode so now that i can


262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
enter a few exclamation points now if we


263
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
go back to the beginning


264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
we can do shift i now we're insert mode


265
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
at the beginning of the line so as you


266
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,399
can see


267
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
the i capital i a capital a are very


268
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
handy for editing in a line


269
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,440
great


270
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
we've talked about navigation we've


271
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,320
talked about editing and align


272
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,399
now the last two that i want to talk


273
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
about are x and r and these are handy


274
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,399
for


275
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,760
making changes while in command mode if


276
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,959
we go back up right here and so i want


277
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,480
to get to the beginning of the sentence


278
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
so i'm going to hit shift i hit escape


279
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
because i want to be in command mode so


280
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
you'll see that i have four j's right i


281
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,160
don't really need all of those so what


282
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
we're going to do is actually use x to


283
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,040
delete those so x is kind of like x out


284
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
of character so i'll hit it three times


285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,079
one two three and now i have one j which


286
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,200
is correct


287
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
so as you can see we're able to make


288
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
edits without leaving command mode so we


289
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
just talked about x for exiting out


290
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,720
characters now let's talk about r


291
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
for replacing characters so i'm going to


292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,040
go to the h here and i want this to be


293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
capital so i'll hit r and then shift h


294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
which is just a a capital h and now it


295
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
will replace it and again i haven't left


296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,079
command mode here let's do this for 22


297
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,279
22. let's change this to


298
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,200
uh 52 22 so we'll hit r and then five


299
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,440
and so basically what it does is it


300
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
replaces the character


301
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
under the cursor with the new character


302
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
that you type in so we've talked about


303
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,200
navigation with hjkl we've talked about


304
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
editing in line with i capital i a and


305
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
capital a and now i've talked about


306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
making changes while in command mode


307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
with x and r i hope you enjoyed that


308
