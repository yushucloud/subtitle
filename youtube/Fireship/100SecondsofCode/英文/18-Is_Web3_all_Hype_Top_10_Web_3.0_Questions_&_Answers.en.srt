1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,639
in the beginning god created web 1.0 it


2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,480
was an information superhighway of


3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,000
documents connected together by


4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,639
hyperlinks and it was good around 2004


5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,719
we saw the emergence of web 2.0 where


6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,240
more people started participating in the


7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
web through platforms like facebook


8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,920
youtube twitter and many others it led


9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,080
to massive centralized tech corporations


10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
that dominate the flow of information


11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,760
and money on the internet we live in


12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,279
interesting times because we're at the


13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
tipping point of web 3.0 a decentralized


14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
but secure internet where people can


15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,599
exchange money and information without


16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
the need for an unnecessary middleman


17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,680
like a bank or tech corporation today's


18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
video is a complete introduction into


19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
the wild world of web 3.0 as an


20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
experienced developer it's humbling to


21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,360
get into because it makes you feel like


22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,879
you know nothing again we'll take a look


23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,800
at the ecosystem from a high level and


24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,559
try to answer all the stupid questions


25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,000
that you'll have when you first get into


26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it like is web 3 all hype and should i


27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
even bother getting into it i would say


28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
yes to both there's obviously a ton of


29
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,199
hype around web3 but not everybody's


30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
buying it even papa elon said that it


31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
sounds like bs just a few days ago i


32
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,800
love the vision of putting the web back


33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,079
in the hands of the people but the


34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,840
reality is that many of these companies


35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
and the cryptocurrencies that they issue


36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
are controlled by vulture capitalists


37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,119
and silicon valley insiders that's not


38
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,880
always the case but much of the industry


39
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
is propped up by fomo and there's a lot


40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
of scams and shady stuff to watch out


41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
for and there are smart people out there


42
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,080
making a very good argument about how


43
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
web 3 doesn't have the computing power


44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
bandwidth or storage to scale on any


45
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
practical level the shills out there


46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
will tell you that crypto is growing


47
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
faster than the internet was in the 90s


48
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
but that's a dumb argument because


49
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,159
crypto is built on top of the internet


50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
itself you could use the same logic for


51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
tick tock crypto is never going to be as


52
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
revolutionary as the internet was but


53
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
that doesn't mean it's not going to be a


54
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,320
big deal here's how i look at it i think


55
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
the best case scenario is that it's like


56
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,399
1992 and things are just getting started


57
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
web 3 is going to grow for another 10


58
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
years and completely revolutionize the


59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
way the world works on the other hand


60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,960
the worst case is that the


61
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
cryptocurrency bubble has already burst


62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
and as it crashes it's going to take web


63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,479
3 down with it for perspective when the


64
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
dot-com bubble burst the stock of amazon


65
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,320
declined by 90 and they were one of the


66
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
lucky companies that actually survived


67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
if ethereum declines 90 just imagine


68
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
what that will do to hashtag web3 but my


69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
next question is do we even need


70
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
cryptocurrency to build decentralized


71
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,319
apps i built a decentralized app on this


72
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,160
channel just a few months ago with gun


73
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,239
js it uses cryptography and web


74
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,080
technologies and has no requirement for


75
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
blockchain technology at all


76
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,800
decentralized tech has been around


77
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
forever like peer-to-peer file sharing


78
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
with napster back in the 90s or


79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
bittorrent which has a hundred million


80
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
monthly active users that being said


81
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
cryptocurrency is still kind of


82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,879
essential because you need some form of


83
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,959
payment to build up a creator economy


84
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,800
and banks are not an acceptable solution


85
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
there it also provides the incentive for


86
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
people to provide the computing


87
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
infrastructure that make the whole thing


88
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,599
possible speaking of which how does a


89
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
decentralized app or dap on the


90
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,280
blockchain work let's use the ethereum


91
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
blockchain as our example although there


92
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,239
are many alternatives with different


93
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
trade-offs out there ethereum is like a


94
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
giant network of computers where all the


95
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
participants agree on the same state of


96
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
the data throughout the network now


97
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
ether is the cryptocurrency on the


98
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
ethereum network which is used to create


99
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
transactions that change the state of


100
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
the data when you broadcast a


101
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
transaction you also offer up a small


102
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
amount of ether which provides incentive


103
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,319
for another computer in the network to


104
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
execute the transaction this is also


105
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
called a gas fee and conceptually it's


106
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,319
similar to paying aws for cloud


107
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,080
computing resources if you want things


108
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
done faster you pay more gas normally


109
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
when you build a web application you


110
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
write some back-end code then deploy it


111
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
to a centralized server like aws for a


112
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
decentralized app on the blockchain your


113
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
backend code is contained in a smart


114
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,720
contract usually written in the solidity


115
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
language which is just an application


116
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,159
that lives on the blockchain that can


117
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,840
govern the behavior between multiple


118
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
accounts a decentralized app also needs


119
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
to have a front end which can be built


120
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
just like a normal website except for


121
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
the fact that user authentication works


122
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
in a completely different way so how


123
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,480
does user identity work in a


124
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
decentralized app unlike web 2.0 the end


125
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
user owns all of their data there's no


126
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
need for you the developer to collect a


127
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,439
username and password the end user has a


128
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
public wallet address that can receive


129
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
payments and a private key that can sign


130
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
transactions to send payments to someone


131
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
else the user can connect their wallet


132
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
to a browser plugin like metamask your


133
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,519
friend application like a react app for


134
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,040
example can then interact with that


135
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
user's wallet to do something


136
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
interesting in the ui like purchase and


137
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
nft um but what is an nft well actually


138
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
what is a token a token is just a


139
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
digital asset we already looked at one


140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
example in this video ether the currency


141
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,639
of ethereum it's a digital asset that


142
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
you can trade with other people but the


143
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
cool thing is that developers can create


144
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,840
their own tokens in the form of smart


145
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
contracts it's basically just a number


146
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
in a smart contract mapped to a wallet


147
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
address in fact if i wanted to create my


148
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
own cryptocurrency i could do so by


149
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,840
writing a smart contract that gives


150
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
myself an initial balance of 1


151
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,199
quadrillion tokens which i can then sell


152
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
to you for one dollar a pop then you


153
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
sell it to your friends for two dollars


154
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
then they sell it to their friends for


155
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
three dollars and we all get super rich


156
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
now i know that sounds like a ponzi


157
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,360
scheme but everything is a goddamn ponzi


158
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
scheme with the us dollar being the


159
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,479
leader in this space so no need to worry


160
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
about ethics or anything in this example


161
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
we've created a fungible token which


162
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
means that one token is always the same


163
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
value as another token of the same size


164
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
one coin is always worth the exact same


165
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
as another coin but tokens can also


166
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,120
represent assets that are not exactly


167
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
alike like baseball cards real estate


168
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
digital artwork and stuff like that


169
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,960
these are examples of non-fungible


170
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
tokens each token is unique and


171
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
represents a different item which means


172
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,320
that its actual market value might be


173
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
different when you go to trade it in for


174
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
some other kind of currency you've


175
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
probably seen the nft craze with entire


176
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
marketplaces like open seas popping up


177
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759
to sell digital artwork as non-fungible


178
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
tokens which is actually a great example


179
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,080
of a highly polished web 3 app now i


180
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
want to switch gears and talk about


181
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
technology what does the front end of a


182
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
web3 application look like for the most


183
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
part it's not much different than a


184
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,960
normal web app you'll likely use a ui


185
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
library like react along with all your


186
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,639
other favorite front-end tools things


187
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,160
become different when we start talking


188
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
about user authentication because like i


189
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
mentioned earlier the end user uses a


190
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
plugin like meta mask to make their


191
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,400
public wallet details available to a


192
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
decentralized app now the question


193
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
becomes how do we as developers connect


194
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,319
to meta mask it's actually really easy


195
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,720
because metamask creates a global object


196
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
on the browser window that we can use to


197
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,479
access details about the wallet now


198
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
figuring out what to do with this data


199
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,840
is actually pretty complicated but


200
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
luckily there's libraries out there to


201
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
make our lives easier the two most


202
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,639
popular options are web3.js and


203
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,440
ethers.js they provide a


204
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
javascript-based api making it much


205
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
easier to interact with the end user and


206
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
smart contracts on the blockchain here's


207
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
an example of how the process might look


208
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
we create a provider with the window


209
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
ethereum object which is used to then


210
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
create a signer you can think of that as


211
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,400
the current user we then connect to a


212
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
smart contract then change the state of


213
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
it which will require the user's


214
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
approval and is based on the logic and


215
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,199
the smart contract itself and that's all


216
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,479
it really takes to initiate a


217
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
transaction on the front end the front


218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
end stuff is pretty simple but what does


219
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
the back end look like in a web web3


220
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
application well it's probably a lot


221
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,800
different than what you're used to as an


222
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
old-timey web developer instead of a


223
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
server and database like php and mysql


224
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,840
you'll be writing smart contracts there


225
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
are frameworks out there designed to


226
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
streamline development two of the most


227
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
popular options are hard hat and truffle


228
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,039
when you add them to your project


229
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,479
they'll give you a place to write a


230
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,400
smart contract in the solidity


231
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
programming language i have a 100 second


232
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
video if you want to learn more but it's


233
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,240
basically an object oriented language


234
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
designed specifically for writing smart


235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,759
contracts on the blockchain that may


236
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,759
sound intimidating but there's a project


237
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
out there called open zeppelin that


238
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
provides templates for writing smart


239
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
contracts that comply to industry


240
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
standards making it extremely easy to


241
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
implement reliable code out of the gate


242
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,479
now the other thing a development tool


243
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,080
chain will do for you is provide a


244
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,240
script to deploy your smart contract to


245
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,160
the blockchain it's just a simple node


246
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
script that signs a contract with your


247
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,919
credentials and deploys it to an address


248
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
on the blockchain now you might be


249
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
wondering how do i test this code before


250
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
i deploy it because i have no idea if


251
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
this thing actually works that's another


252
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
thing that hardhat and truffle can help


253
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,479
you out with they can create a testing


254
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
network on localhost then generate a


255
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
bunch of wallet addresses loaded up with


256
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
fake crypto that you can use for testing


257
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,160
in the browser you can connect metamask


258
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
to your testing network instead of


259
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,759
operating on the actual ethereum network


260
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
in addition if you're building a serious


261
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,879
app you should consider writing


262
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,479
automated tests for it and there's a


263
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
library called waffle that can help you


264
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
do that that's what a basic


265
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
decentralized app looks like but one


266
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,360
more stupid question you might have is


267
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
do i store all my data in the blockchain


268
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,599
the answer is no it's not efficient or


269
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,360
necessary to store everything in the


270
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,039
blockchain and that's where off-chain


271
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
storage comes in in some cases data


272
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,479
might be too large to store on the


273
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,319
blockchain or it might need to be


274
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
modified or deleted which is not


275
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
possible in a blockchain where all the


276
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
data is read only the most common


277
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
solution is the interplanetary file


278
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
system or ipfs it's a decentralized way


279
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
to share files very similar to the way


280
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,000
bittorrent works and there's also


281
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
databases built on top of ipfs like


282
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
orbitdb and threaddb which is kind of


283
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,360
like a peer-to-peer version of mongodb


284
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
if you've made it this far in the video


285
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
you might be thinking web3 looks awesome


286
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
but how do i get started i'm working on


287
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
a full step-by-step tutorial that will


288
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
be out on the channel soon so make sure


289
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,680
you're subscribed to catch that the


290
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
easiest way to start messing around with


291
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
smart contracts is with the remix ide


292
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
it's a browser-based tool that will


293
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
handle all the compilation and


294
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,839
everything for you so you don't have to


295
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
mess around with any javascript on


296
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
youtube there are a couple of really


297
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,399
good channels that i want to mention one


298
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,640
is hash libs for working with nfts and


299
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
the other one is nader dabit just for


300
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,880
all around wisdom related to web3 i'm


301
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,240
gonna go ahead and wrap things up there


302
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
if you have more questions about web3


303
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,279
let me know in the comments and i'm


304
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
curious to know if you think web 3 is


305
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
the future or if you think it's just a


306
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
big nothing burger thanks for watching


307
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,839
and i will see you in the next one
