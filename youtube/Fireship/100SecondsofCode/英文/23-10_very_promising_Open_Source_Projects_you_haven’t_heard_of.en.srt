[Music]


2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,240
i just discovered a way to build a


3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,240
billion dollar startup entirely from


4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
free open source software from the most


5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
talented programmers in the world


6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,840
actually everybody knows that already


7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
like why pay an engineer when you can


8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,040
just use their stuff for free on github


9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,639
in today's video we're going to cheat


10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,920
off the smart kid's homework and look at


11
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,279
some of the coolest open source


12
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,800
libraries that you've never heard of


13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
tools that will make your apps faster


14
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
better looking and less expensive to run


15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
you'll ask yourself what the [__] how


16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,519
have i not been using that already and


17
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,320
that brings us to library number one the


18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
normally when you type a command into


19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
the terminal and make a typo you just


20
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
say [__] in your head and then retype


21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
the command from scratch the [__] makes


22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
this process much more intuitive


23
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
allowing you to simply type [__] into


24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,280
the terminal then it will attempt to


25
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
reformat your command automatically to


26
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,480
be honest it's pretty [__] useful


27
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,239
here's a problem that anybody who's ever


28
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
built a website is faced


29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
it's too slow even if you work really


30
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
hard to create a tiny javascript bundle


31
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,879
the product manager will eventually tell


32
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,399
you to add a bunch of other chunks like


33
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,640
mixpanel intercom and google analytics


34
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,239
these third party scripts clog up the


35
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,760
main thread and will make your app slow


36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,520
no matter what luckily there's an open


37
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
source library called partytown that can


38
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,600
run third party scripts from a webworker


39
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
javascript is single threaded but modern


40
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,280
browsers allow you to run background


41
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
jobs via web workers partytown will


42
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
offload any scripts that don't deal


43
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
directly with the ui into a webworker


44
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,400
and that means the only thing on the


45
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
main thread is your ui which leads to a


46
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,640
faster more responsive website another


47
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,159
problem that every app developer will


48
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
need to solve is user authentication


49
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,680
firebase is great but it's somewhat


50
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
feature limited auth0 is great but it's


51
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,759
expensive and that brings us to super


52
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
tokens which is an open source


53
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
authentication solution it provides sdks


54
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
for runtimes like node and python


55
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,600
allowing you to quickly self-host a


56
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,520
fully featured authentication system


57
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
with support for oauth providers


58
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
passwordless login but most importantly


59
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
it deals with session management and


60
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,200
security pretty cool but it's got


61
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,119
nothing on this next one hi mom is a


62
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,280
blazingly fast javascript library that


63
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
can say hi to your mom in record time


64
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,720
here's a pro tip if you're building an


65
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
open source library make sure that the


66
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
readme includes phrases like blazingly


67
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
fast bleeding edge holistic approach and


68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
game changing because they make your


69
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,079
library better the same way putting


70
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
flame stickers on a car makes it go


71
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
faster next up we have a two for one


72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,599
many businesses out there need to build


73
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,440
their own full tech search engine either


74
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
for internal data or to build a search


75
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
engine for their customers you could go


76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
with elasticsearch but it's expensive


77
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
and complicated if you self-host there


78
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
are two very promising open source


79
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
alternatives one is melee search


80
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
implemented in rust and the other is


81
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,239
zinc implemented in go both provide a


82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
fast simplified way to build your own


83
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
search engine now our next library trcp


84
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,720
tprc trpc is exceptionally cool but a


85
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,160
little harder to explain if you're


86
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
building an api today there are two main


87
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
approaches rest and graphql i won't go


88
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
into the differences right now although


89
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599
i do have videos for that but there's


90
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,280
another less talked about approach


91
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
called rpc or remote procedure call and


92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,239
basically it's just a url on a server


93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,080
but unlike rest that corresponds to an


94
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,239
entity it corresponds to a function that


95
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,599
you want to run on the server this


96
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,280
approach actually makes a ton of sense


97
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,159
for many modern applications trpc allows


98
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,560
you to build entirely type safe apis


99
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,319
without the need for schemas or code


100
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
generation like you would with graphql


101
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
overall i think it has the potential to


102
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,159
fundamentally simplify the way we build


103
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,080
full stack web applications speaking of


104
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
simplification one company that has


105
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,599
simplified the modern database is


106
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
airtable the only problem is that you


107
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,360
have to pay a company to use it if only


108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
there was an open source alternative


109
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
nokodi does exactly that it's an open


110
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
source air table that can be built on


111
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
top of your own mysql or postgres


112
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,280
database in other words it's an open


113
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
source no code database or smart


114
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
spreadsheet as a developer another piece


115
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
of software you may want to replace is


116
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
postman your http client an awesome open


117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,159
source alternative is hopscotch which is


118
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,239
built with vue.js and typescript


119
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,319
entirely as a progressive web app not


120
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
only is it open source but you can go


121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
use it in the browser right now at


122
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
hopscotch io and then install it as a


123
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
pwa on your desktop and now it runs in a


124
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
native window and allows you to interact


125
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
with your file system now if you've ever


126
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
coded in python then try javascript


127
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
later you might be shocked at how


128
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,640
difficult it is to work with


129
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
multi-dimensional arrays what is this in


130
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
python we have libraries like pandas


131
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
that can do all kinds of useful stuff to


132
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
an array or data frame not many people


133
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,239
realize that there's a library called


134
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,840
danfo.js that is inspired by pandas and


135
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,280
can do many of the things you know and


136
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,519
love like read a csv file and process


137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
the data within it before it gets sent


138
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
to a machine learning library like


139
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
tensorflow that's pretty useful but the


140
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
hardest thing in front-end web


141
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
development is making your website look


142
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
good there's a million different tools


143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
out there that can help you do that but


144
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
one i've been really loving recently for


145
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
react is manteen not only does it have a


146
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
bunch of well-crafted ui components like


147
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
this nice-looking timeline but it also


148
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
has a bunch of built-in hooks that


149
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
handle many of the annoying things that


150
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,919
you'll come across when building a web


151
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
app like debouncing an input or


152
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
paginating a collection of items on top


153
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,919
of that it has optional packages for a


154
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
notification system rich text editor and


155
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
a drop zone for file uploads it's so


156
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,759
awesome that we use it in one of the


157
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
demo apps in the full react course on


158
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
fireship io check it out if you want to


159
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
build a serious app with react now the


160
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,039
problem with all the libraries that


161
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,479
we've looked at so far is that they


162
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
require you to know how to write some


163
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,919
code if you have an idea for a full


164
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,000
stack application but want to skip the


165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
whole learn to code part an open source


166
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
tool to check out is application it's a


167
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,919
tool that can automatically generate


168
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,240
both your frontend and backend code


169
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
based on relationships to data models in


170
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
a database that you can manage visually


171
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
the backend is built with other open


172
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
source tools like node nest js and


173
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
prisma while the front end is based on


174
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
react even if you do know how to code


175
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,000
this is a tool that can speed up your


176
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,759
workflow and that gives you 10 new open


177
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
source libraries to try out in your next


178
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
project hit the like button and


179
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
subscribe thanks for watching and i will


180
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,400
see you in the next one
