1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,600
raspberry pi


2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
a computer that fits in the palm of your


3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,879
hand with a price tag


4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,960
as low as five dollars the idea was born


5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,200
in 2006 and the first commercial unit


6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,559
was launched in 2012


7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,480
and since then it's evolved into one of


8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,240
the best selling computers in the world


9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,000
it's named raspberry because computer


10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
companies like to name themselves after


11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,400
fruit and


12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,560
pie for the python programming language


13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
not only is the computer tiny but it can


14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
also be quite powerful


15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
with a quad core processor and up to


16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,439
eight gigabytes of ram they're great for


17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
building your own iot prototypes robots


18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
security cameras web servers and many


19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,600
other fun projects


20
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
when you unbox your raspberry pi 4


21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,120
you'll notice a bunch of little chips


22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,000
and connectors


23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
in the center we have our cpu and ram


24
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,559
that is the brain of the operation


25
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,960
nearby is the wi-fi bluetooth module


26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,719
that can wirelessly connect to the


27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,760
outside world


28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
at the top we have a general purpose


29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,960
input output connector


30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,039
for connecting other electrical devices


31
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,480
to the right we have an ethernet


32
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
connection along with four usb ports


33
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,960
on the bottom we have an audio jack two


34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
connect speakers or headphones


35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,879
a csi camera connector for building your


36
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,159
own custom camera


37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,799
micro hdmi ports for connecting multiple


38
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,520
monitors


39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
and finally a usb c port to provide


40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
power to the computer but most


41
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,159
importantly


42
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
flip the raspberry pi over to find the


43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,439
micro sd slot


44
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,960
think of it as a hard drive that


45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
contains the operating system required


46
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,360
to


47
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
interface with the hardware you can use


48
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
the raspberry pi like a normal desktop


49
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,920
computer


50
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759
by connecting a keyboard mouse and


51
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,280
monitor when you power it up the first


52
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,400
time you can install


53
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
any operating system you'd like but most


54
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,920
beginners will take advantage of the


55
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,880
noobs installer


56
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
which installs a flavor of linux called


57
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,479
raspberry pi os


58
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
now that you're in you can program it to


59
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,920
take over the world you might connect


60
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
some leds to the gpio header then


61
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
control them with a python script or you


62
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,000
might add a camera then connect to wi-fi


63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
to build your own home security system


64
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,479
from scratch


65
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
the possibilities are limited only by


66
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,520
your imagination


67
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
this has been raspberry pi in 100


68
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520

see more raspberry pi content let me


73
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,399

74
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
