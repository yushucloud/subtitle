1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,639
the linux file system it's a cryptic


2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,720
labyrinth of directories defined by the


3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,720
file system hierarchy standard


4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,320
navigate through it with the change


5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
directory command cd forward slash drops


6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,840
you into the root


7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,679
then with the ls command we can list out


8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,360
the contents of this directory


9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,119
first we have the bin directory which


10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,560
contains binaries or


11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
executables that are essential to the


12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
entire operating system


13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,439
you can run these binaries from the


14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
command line at any time things like


15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
gzip curl and even the ls command that


16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,880
we just ran


17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,119
but confusingly there's also an s-bin


18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
directory it contains system binaries


19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
that should only be executed by the root


20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,680
user


21
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,320
like mount or delete user many of these


22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,559
binaries may share common libraries


23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,719
which are stored in the lib directory


24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,480
now we also have a usr


25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
user directory with its own bin and


26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,920
s-bin directories


27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
the binaries or applications here are


28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
non-essential to the operating system


29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,079
itself and intended for the end user


30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
you'll also notice a local directory


31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
under user


32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
it contains any binaries that you


33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,960
compile manually to provide a safe place


34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,800
that won't conflict with any software


35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,960
installed by a system package manager


36
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,720
all these binaries get mapped together


37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
with the path environment variable


38
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,320
and that's why you can execute them from


39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,159
any directory in the terminal if you


40
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
ever want to know where a binary lives


41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,159
run which followed by the binary name to


42
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,200
view its full path


43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,119
in the file system now at some point you


44
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
may want to customize the behavior of


45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
the software on your system


46
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,119
the etc directory stands for etc or


47
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,880
editable text configuration


48
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,799
many of these files end in conf and


49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,479
they're typically just text-based config


50
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,840
files that you can modify


51
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
in your editor as an operating system


52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
linux can support multiple users


53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
in the home directory you'll find a


54
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
folder named after each user registered


55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,560
on the system


56
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,720
it contains the files configuration and


57
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,079
software for that user


58
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,600
and you need to be logged in as that


59
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
user or as a root user to modify it


60
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
notice how the file path is a squiggly


61
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,759
that's your normal starting location


62
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,520
when you open up a terminal session


63
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,200
now let's go back to the root there are


64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
a few more directories here that we


65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,840
haven't talked about yet


66
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
like boot it contains the files needed


67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,040
to boot the system


68
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
like the linux kernel itself then we


69
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,360
have dev which stands for device files


70
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,040
here you can interface with hardware or


71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,119
drivers as if they were regular files


72
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,200
you might create disk partitions here or


73
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,879
interface with your floppy drive


74
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,040
the op directory contains optional or


75
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,080
add-on software


76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,239
and you'll rarely interact with it var


77
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
contains variable files that will change


78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,720
as


79
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
the operating system is being used


80
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
things like logs and


81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
cache files temp is for temporary files


82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,720
that won't be persisted between reboots


83
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
and finally we have the weirdest one of


84
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,879
all


85
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,800
the proc directory is an illusionary


86
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,879
file system that doesn't actually exist


87
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,599
on the disk


88
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,760
but is created in memory on the fly by


89
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
the linux kernel


90
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
to keep track of running processes this


91
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
has been the linux file system in 100


92
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,840
seconds


93
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
