1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
react native write javascript and react


2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,440
to build apps for ios android and the


3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
web from a single codebase according to


4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,840
atwood's law any application that can be


5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
written in javascript will eventually be


6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,759
written in javascript the first way js


7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,280
developers tried to build mobile apps


8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,400
was by wrapping their native


9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
applications in a sandbox browser called


10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
a webview using tools like apache


11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
cordova and adobe phonegap the


12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,119
philosophy is right once run anywhere


13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,800
this works but it can be hard to make a


14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
website feel like a true native


15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
experience react native takes a


16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,160
different approach it feels just like


17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,239
react dom for the web but instead of


18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,480
using html and the dom as building


19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
blocks for the ui it uses the native


20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
components that you would find on ios


21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,120
and android the philosophy is learn once


22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,719
right anywhere you can't just take your


23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
existing react web app and upload it to


24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,879
the app store but you can use the react


25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,399
skills you already have to build a


26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,239
native app without ever having to touch


27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,960
java or objective c instead you import


28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
building block components like button


29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
switch scroll view and the most


30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
fundamental of which is view at runtime


31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,120
it will use the true native component on


32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,560
the corresponding platform like uiview


33
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,400
android.view or div on the web it's like


34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,479
building three apps for the price of one


35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,159
but in some cases you may want a


36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
different visual experience based on the


37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
underlying os the platform module allows


38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
you to check which platform you're on


39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,520
and render different components


40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
accordingly when it comes to visuals


41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
there's no css in react native instead


42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
every core component takes a style prop


43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
that can be customized with a style


44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
sheet constructed from javascript in


45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
development it supports fast refresh


46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,439
which means you can instantly see the


47
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,200
changes you make to your code on any


48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
platform you may also want to tap into


49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
native features like the device camera


50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
push notifications and geolocation these


51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,439
concerns are handled by one of the most


52
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
active open source communities on github


53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
there's open source packages for almost


54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
everything that can be installed with


55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
npm just like any other javascript


56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
project and there's frameworks like expo


57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,240
that build on top of react native


58
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
primitives to provide all the tooling


59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
required to ship your app to production


60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,439
you can use react native to build a


61
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,280
complete mobile app or integrate it with


62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
existing ios and android projects it's


63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,439
not an all or nothing solution this has


64
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
been react native in 100 seconds if you


65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,200
