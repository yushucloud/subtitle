00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
hypertext markup language or html is a


2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
language that defines the structure of


3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,919
content on a webpage development started


4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,200
in 1989 at cern by tim berners-lee who


5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,799
had just invented the world's first web


6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
browser world wide web the origin of www


7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,320
but he needed a publishing language to


8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
display content within it so he chose a


9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,640
syntax based on the standard generalized


10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
markup language which uses opening and


11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
closing tags to provide meaning to


12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,119
otherwise unorganized text like h4


13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,119
heading p for paragraph and most


14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,760
importantly a for anchor to link to a


15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
different web page the language


16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
underwent many changes during the


17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
initial rise of the internet and was


18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,120
standardized as html5 in 2008 the


19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,040
version we know and love today modern


20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
html contains tags to handle a variety


21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,760
of different media types like video


22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
audio and canvas to draw custom graphics


23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
on the fly the typical html element


24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
starts with an opening and closing tag


25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
in the middle we have content which


26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,879
might be text or additional html


27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
elements called children the opening tag


28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,199
may also have one or more attributes


29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,799
which are key value pairs that can


30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
customize the appearance or behavior of


31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
the element to build your first web page


32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
create a file named index.html this file


33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
contains a hierarchy of nodes based on


34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
the document object model or dom a


35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
webpage starts with an html tag and has


36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,000
exactly two children a head and a body


37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,759
the head contains things that aren't


38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,840
directly shown in the webpage like a


39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,479
title or a meta tag to give the page a


40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,320
description but notice how the meta


41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,799
element has no closing tag closing tags


42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,560
are generally optional when an element


43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
is fully self-contained the body


44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
contains the actual ui for the end user


45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
we might start with an h1 heading


46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
followed by a paragraph of content to


47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
add an image we use an image tag which


48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
you'll notice is self-closing then


49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
define the source attribute as the file


50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
path to the image and you'll want to


51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,840
give it an old description to make it


52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
accessible to robots and screen readers


53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
what makes web pages revolutionary


54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
though is their ability to link to other


55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
web pages on the information super


56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,280
highway use an anchor tag to create a


57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
link then define the href attributes as


58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
the webpage that you want to navigate to


59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,360
when clicked html also provides


60
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,920
structural tags like division or div


61
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,680
which are often used to group elements


62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
together where they can be styled to


63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
represent complex ui elements like


64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
navbars when you're happy with your code


65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
grab the full file path to the html file


66
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
and paste it into any web browser


67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,280
