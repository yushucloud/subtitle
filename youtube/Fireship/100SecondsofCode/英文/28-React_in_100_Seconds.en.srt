00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,720
react a javascript library for building


2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,799
user interfaces developed at facebook


3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,799
and released in 2013 it's safe to say


4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,639
react has been the most influential ui


5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,800
library of recent memory we use it to


6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,799
build components that represent logical


7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,120
reusable parts of the ui the beauty of


8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,119
react is that the simplicity of building


9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,880
a component has been brought down to its


10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,560
theoretical minimum it's just a


11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,960
javascript function it's so easy a


12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
caveman could do it the return value


13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
from this function is your html or ui


14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,119
which is written in a special syntax


15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,039
called jsx allowing you to easily


16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
combine javascript with html markup if


17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,280
you want to pass data into a component


18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
you simply pass it a props argument


19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,399
which you can then reference inside the


20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,040
function body or in the ui using braces


21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
if the value changes react will react to


22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
update the ui if we want to give our


23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,680
component its own internal state we can


24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
use the state hook the hook is just a


25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
function that returns a value as well as


26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
a function to change the value in this


27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
case count is our reactive state and


28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,239
setcount will change the state when used


29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,920
in the template the count will always


30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
show the most recent value then we can


31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,359
bind set count to a button click event


32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,600
so the user can change the state react


33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
provides a variety of other built-in


34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
hooks to handle common use cases but the


35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
main reason you might want to use react


36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
is not the library itself but the


37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
massive ecosystem that surrounds it


38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
react itself doesn't care about routing


39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
state management animation or anything


40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,920
like that instead it lets those concerns


41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
evolve naturally within the open source


42
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,960
community no matter what you're trying


43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
to do there's very likely a good


44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,080
supporting library to help you get it


45
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,320
done need a static site you have gatsby


46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
need server side rendering you have next


47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
for animation you have spring for forums


48
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,840
you have formic state management you've


49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,400
got redux mobx flux recoil x state and


50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,840
more you have an endless supply of


51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,439
choices to get things done the way you


52
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,439
like it as an added bonus once you have


53
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
reactdown you can easily jump into react


54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
native and start building mobile apps


55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
and it's no surprise that knowing this


56
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,320
little ui library is one of the most


57
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,680
in-demand skills for front-end


58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,759
