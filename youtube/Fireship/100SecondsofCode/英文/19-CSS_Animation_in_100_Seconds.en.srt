1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,250
animation it's the change from one CSS


2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,020
style to another over the dimension of


3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,910
time every animation has at least two


4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,980
states a starting point and an ending


5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,960
point when you move from start to finish


6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,179
CSS will calculate all the values in


7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,009
between in computer science this is


8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,109
called inbetweening or a tween animation


9
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,150
imagine we have an element that we want


10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,550
to fade in over a duration of one second


11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,289
when the animation starts the browser


12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,660
calculates a new a pasty value for every


13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,760
frame rendered and it does so using a


14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,619
linear timing function which means the


15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,359
amount of change that occurs to the CSS


16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,669
value is exactly the same for each unit


17
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,350
of time but in the real physical world


18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,300
things rarely move at a perfect linear


19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,910
pace things ease in ease out and change


20
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,800
the velocity gracefully you can do the


21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,750
same in your CSS animations by providing


22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,520
a timing function there are many


23
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,050
built-in functions where you can define


24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,360
your own custom veggie acres the easiest


25
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,399
way to create an animation with CSS is


26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
with a transition start by adding the


27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,329
transition property to a selector the


28
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,860
first value is the property that you


29
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,390
want to animate in our case its opacity


30
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,940
the second value is the duration you can


31
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,309
define it in seconds or milliseconds now


32
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,840
whenever the opacity for this element


33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,909
changes CSS will automatically handle


34
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,130
the animation for you for example we can


35
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,810
target the hover pseudo selector and


36
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,880
change the opacity to one and that's all


37
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,409
it takes to create a fade-in fade-out


38
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,840
animation with CSS we can refine this


39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,790
animation by adding an additional value


40
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,130
for a delay or a timing function use a


41
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,900
built-in easing function or create your


42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,060
own custom as the a curve but what if


43
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,770
you want to animate something forever or


44
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,049
in multiple steps keyframes allow you to


45
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,759
define animations independent of a


46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,409
selector first give your keyframe


47
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,939
animation a name then define your


48
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,409
starting styles with from and your


49
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,450
ending styles with to any intermediate


50
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,280
styles or steps in the animation can be


51
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,380
defined as a percentage in relative time


52
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,210
to the starting point if your animation


53
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,820
is 4 seconds long then 25% would be 1


54
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,890
second into that animation you can use


55
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,810
this animation by referencing it as the


56
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,549
animation name in one of your selectors


57
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,320
give it a duration and timing function


58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,880
then change the iteration count to


59
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,740
infinite to make it loop forever this

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,990
