with it when the form is submitted


37
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,909
you'll write a function that takes the

parts of the world now have regulations


45
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,130
in place that require additional


46
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,140
authorization for the payment the


47
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,970
payment intent now has a status of


48
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,100
requires action a strike will handle


49
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,570
this process for you entirely in the


50
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,189

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,560
been paid but you're not done just yet


54
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,329
you still need to fulfill the product


55
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,220
somehow anytime something important


56
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,840
happens in the stripe API like when a


57
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,670
payment intent succeeds you can listen


58
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,290
to these events by setting up web hooks


59
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,329
when the event occurs stripe will send


60
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,890
this data to your server so you can


61
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,630
handle it accordingly like updating your


62
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,310
apps database or printing out a shipping


63
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,899
