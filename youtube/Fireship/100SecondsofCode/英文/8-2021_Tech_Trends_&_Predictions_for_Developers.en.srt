1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,560
not very much happened in 2020 bootstrap


2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,560
5 was released a star disappeared


3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,560
angular added a new date picker a bunch


4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,680
of stuff caught on fire


5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,440
view 3 was finally released beirut


6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,440
exploded react suspense left us in


7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,160
suspense


8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,719
murder hornets r.i.p kobe eddie and kim


9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,800
spacex used web components while elon


10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
got hacked ufos are real


11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
ufos are real lambda supports containers


12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
while kubernetes drops docker


13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
slack sold out ai learned how to write


14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,359
code and when donald trump starts his


15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
second term in january i think 2021 will


16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,880
be an even better year


17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
2020 has been a defining year for tech


18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
they've been big winners and big losers


19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
today we'll look at seven predictions


20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,480
about tech going into 2021


21
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,079
along with a bunch of events and trends


22
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,160
from 2020 that provide a roadmap for


23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,760
developers relating to the web


24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,399
backend mobile ai and more if you're new


25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,520
here like and subscribe


26
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
then let's get right into it the office


27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,640
is dead


28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
and that's a great thing both for


29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
companies and their employees no commute


30
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,120
better work life balance


31
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
live where you want and the list goes on


32
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,280
2020 forced virtually every company to


33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,359
embrace and implement remote work


34
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,800
big companies like microsoft and


35
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
facebook are now permanently allowing


36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,840
many of their employees to work from


37
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,320
home


38
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,159
this has led to an exodus of people from


39
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
silicon valley to more affordable cities


40
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
throughout the united states


41
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
i happen to be a california refugee


42
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,400
myself and while it's a great place to


43
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
visit living there kind of sucks


44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,119
but the great thing about a global


45
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,640
pandemic is that now you can live


46
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
wherever you want


47
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,280
and still bring in a six-figure tech


48
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
salary the bad news here though is that


49
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
i predict this will make the job market


50
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,840
more competitive


51
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,439
with jobs moving out of the valley you


52
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,799
now have to compete with everyone in the


53
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,720
united states or potentially everyone in


54
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
the world for a role


55
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,920
regardless it is still a great time to


56
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,439
learn to code and there's more options


57
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,320
than ever before


58
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,920
if you're self-motivated you can get a


59
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
better education here on youtube than


60
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,799
you could sitting through four years of


61
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,640
college and many big companies like


62
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,520
apple and google


63
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
no longer require college degrees for


64
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,439
software engineers overall when you take


65
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,079
a step back


66
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,759
the tech industry has fared much better


67
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,520
than virtually every other industry in


68
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
this new dystopian normal that we live


69
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,479
in


70
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
javascript frameworks are dead well


71
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,159
maybe dead's not the right word


72
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
they're done reinventing the wheel or


73
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,840
innovating i should say at least in ways


74
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
that will change the current status quo


75
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,360
react has been the dominant framework or


76
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,880
library with the majority of the market


77
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
share as long as we pretend jquery


78
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,280
doesn't exist


79
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,879
followed by angular and view fighting


80
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,479
for a distant second place


81
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
and a bunch of other good frameworks


82
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
like svelt ember and lit element in a


83
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
distant third place


84
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,560
i don't expect things to change much in


85
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
the future when react released hooks


86
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,360
back in 2019


87
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,800
people acted like it was going to end


88
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
world hunger while hooks are great


89
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
and they inspired things like views


90
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
composition api i think it signaled the


91
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
beginning of the end for the javascript


92
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,800
framework wars


93
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
there's been a constant push in the


94
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
javascript world to create new releases


95
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
that do things differently year after


96
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
year that's led to the awesome


97
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
javascript frameworks we enjoy today but


98
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
it does feel like the constant churn is


99
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
really slowing down


100
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
and that's probably a good thing on a


101
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,959
similar note the javascript language


102
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,760
itself or


103
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
ecmascript is pretty much done getting


104
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
better at this point


105
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
javascript and especially when used with


106
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
typescript is an awesome language to


107
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
work with by any standard over the last


108
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,959
five years or so


109
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
it's experienced a renaissance with a


110
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
whole bunch of powerful new features


111
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
being added to it but in 2021


112
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
things look pretty quiet for javascript


113
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
there are a couple of new features


114
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,280
finalized


115
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
like logical assignment operators that


116
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
allow you to assign a variable if it's


117
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,319
not already defined


118
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
also called the mallet operator overall


119
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
nothing too game changing and if you use


120
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
typescript you can already use the


121
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,720
syntax today


122
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,760
speaking of which and i've been


123
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
predicting this for years typescript


124
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,959
will continue to dominate


125
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,640
it's already used by almost everybody


126
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
for big complex projects


127
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,440
but i think there will be even more


128
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
adoption now that we have deno which is


129
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
a brand new javascript runtime that came


130
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
out in 2020 that runs typescript


131
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,680
natively


132
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,599
it's an alternative to node.js and i


133
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,040
think we'll see a lot of growth in deno


134
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,159
over the next few years


135
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,760
and another thing i'm excited about is a


136
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
new build tool called snowpack


137
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
it makes it really fast and easy to


138
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
start a project with typescript and your


139
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
preferred framework the most exciting


140
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,000
thing for the web though has nothing to


141
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
do with javascript which brings me to my


142
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,959
next prediction


143
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
web apps and native apps will become


144
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
more indistinguishable than ever


145
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
and there are two main reasons for this


146
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,799
web assembly and the web platform itself


147
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,400
or a collection of features that we call


148
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
progressive web apps webassembly is a


149
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,599
common target


150
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
that multiple languages can compile to


151
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,799
which means that you can now build high


152
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,400
performance web applications with


153
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
languages other than javascript


154
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
on top of that the web platform or


155
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,159
browsers now have most of the features


156
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,840
that used to only be available for


157
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,640
native apps


158
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
things like push notifications offline


159
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
mode background sync


160
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
bluetooth and many more and what this


161
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
means as a developer


162
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,040
is that you can deliver a full native


163
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
app experience entirely through the free


164
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
and open platform known as the web


165
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
and that really begs the question of why


166
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
are we giving apple or google 30


167
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
of our revenue just to use a closed off


168
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
marketplace that supports censorship


169
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
unfair distribution and bans on


170
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,919
third-party payment systems


171
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,840
everybody knows it's unfair and epic


172
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
games went to court with apple in 2020.


173
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
it's a long way off but hopefully


174
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
developers see the opportunity of


175
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
developing progressive web apps with


176
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,280
webassembly


177
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,120
and get consumers comfortable with using


178
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
apps outside of the app store


179
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
the technology is here today but i think


180
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
it'll take multiple years to see any


181
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
meaningful change in that direction so


182
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
we might as well just move on


183
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
artificial intelligence will not take


184
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
your job or maybe it will


185
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,000
they took our job by now you've likely


186
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
heard of gpt-3


187
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
which of course is a generative


188
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
pre-trained auto aggressive transformer


189
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,440
language model


190
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
it can do all kinds of scary things


191
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
including write code this guy on twitter


192
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,479
built an app where you can describe the


193
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
layout of a website and it will generate


194
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
the actual html css and react code and


195
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,479
now it looks like he's building a whole


196
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
startup around this concept


197
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
i don't think you have to worry about ai


198
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
taking your job and here's why


199
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
once ai starts to write code it'll be


200
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
able to create its own ai


201
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
and that'll be the true inflection point


202
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
propelling us to the technological


203
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
singularity at which point we'll all


204
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
fuse together as one bio digital


205
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,919
organism


206
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,840
or our new digital overlords might


207
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
enslave or exterminate us


208
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,639
in either case you don't have to worry


209
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,240
about ai taking your job


210
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
what you do have to worry about right


211
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,199
now is something entirely different and


212
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,240
that's the no code


213
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
low code revolution which might take


214
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,800
your job


215
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
there are a variety of tools out there


216
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
now that make it easier for people


217
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
without engineering skills to develop


218
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,080
apps


219
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,440
there are tools like webflow for


220
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
building websites then amazon has


221
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
honeycode and google has app sheet for


222
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
building mobile apps


223
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
over the last couple years there's been


224
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,479
a ton of venture capital flowing into


225
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,000
low code no code apps


226
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
it's a great area to be in if you're a


227
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,199
startup but you might be wondering if


228
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,800
these tools will take your job


229
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,039
my prediction is that they will not if


230
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,560
anything i think they'll make developers


231
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,720
more valuable because they abstract away


232
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
some of the most annoying parts of being


233
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,000
a developer for example


234
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
you might use a no-code tool to scaffold


235
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
out a ui very quickly


236
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,639
instead of taking a week to build a


237
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
baseline prototype you now have one in a


238
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,960
few minutes


239
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
and you can move on to the more exciting


240
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
features that low code tools can't


241
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,639
handle


242
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
in fact if you're a developer working on


243
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,840
something repetitive that could be


244
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
represented with a drag and drop ui you


245
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
probably have a great idea for a startup


246
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
in your hands and vcs will throw money


247
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
at it without batting an eye


248
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
the server is dead long live serverless


249
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
which are actually just servers but ones


250
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,039
that you never have to think about or


251
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,680
maintain


252
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
the growth of serverless computing has


253
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
been accelerating for the last few years


254
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
with tools like aws lambda azure


255
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
functions and google cloud functions


256
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,919
leading the way


257
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,840
but in the past there are a few reasons


258
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
you may have not wanted to use functions


259
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,680
one of which is high latency when they


260
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
initially start known as a cold start


261
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
but in 2020 we got a new feature from


262
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
aws lambda called provisioned


263
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
concurrency which ensures you always


264
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,280
have a hot function available


265
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
to give you predictable latency but


266
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
another big drawback of serverless


267
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
is that you can't control the runtime


268
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
with a dock or container but just a few


269
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,440
days ago


270
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
aws announced that lambda supports


271
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
containers and you also have tools like


272
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,039
google cloud run that have supported


273
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,880
serverless containers for a while


274
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
the bottom line is that serverless


275
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,240
functions are becoming suitable for more


276
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
and more use cases


277
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
on top of that we're now starting to see


278
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,639
more serverless databases


279
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,680
like firestore for example or faunadb in


280
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
the not so distant future


281
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
i think it'll be rare for a developer to


282
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
have to think about how they scale or


283
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
maintain their backend infrastructure


284
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,919
everything will just magically work in


285
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,199
the cloud similar to how your


286
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
electricity works when you plug


287
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,680
something into the wall


288
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
it just works unless there's a massive


289
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
outage and then you pay your bill based


290
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,000
on what the meter says


291
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
at the end of the month it's incredibly


292
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
simple and the industry has been


293
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
trending this way for a long time


294
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,479
now i wanted to save my worst prediction


295
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,240
for last i believe it's possible we


296
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
might see a black swan type event in


297
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,199
2021


298
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,199
just like we did in 2020 with the rona


299
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
when the market crashed back in march


300
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
it rapidly recovered back to all-time


301
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
highs in less than a year the recovery


302
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
was led by the tech industry


303
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
and driven by stimulus from the


304
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
government and money printing from the


305
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,759
federal reserve


306
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,280
tons and tons of tech companies went


307
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,039
public during this period using


308
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,440
s-pacs or special purpose acquisition


309
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,160
companies


310
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
meanwhile everybody that's locked up at


311
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,360
home has learned how to become a day


312
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
trader which turns out to be pretty easy


313
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
when the stock market does nothing but


314
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,759
go up and up and up


315
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,520
all this has contributed to companies


316
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
with insane valuations


317
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
just look at companies like snowflake


318
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,560
that went public this year 100 billion


319
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,719
dollar market cap on only 400 million in


320
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,360
revenue


321
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,919
and a loss of 350 million and there are


322
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
many other stocks just like it


323
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
that don't make any money have modest


324
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
growth yet their stock prices have


325
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
doubled or tripled over the last few


326
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,560
months


327
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
this can't go on forever and eventually


328
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,920
there will be some kind of catalyst to


329
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
bring everything crashing down


330
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
companies that don't make a profit can


331
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,959
only survive with a high stock price


332
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,560
or an infusion of cash from somewhere


333
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,320
else if the market does crash again


334
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,920
there's a very high potential for job


335
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,040
loss in the tech industry


336
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
and potentially lost opportunities for


337
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
entrepreneurs now don't get me wrong i


338
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,800
hope the party keeps rolling in 2021


339
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
my youtube channel depends on it but i'm


340
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
just anticipating the eventual hangover


341
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,839
i'm gonna go ahead and wrap things up


342
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,240
there


343
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
you can support the channel by becoming


344
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
a pro member at fireship io


345
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
or by sponsoring me personally on github


346
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,959
i just wanted to say thank you to


347
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
everybody for making 2020 an awesome


348
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
year despite all the craziness


349
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
thanks for watching and i will see you


350
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
in the next one
