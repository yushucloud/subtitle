1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
electrons build native desktop apps for


2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,350
platforms like Mac OS and Windows using


3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,500
nothing but HTML CSS and JavaScript it's


4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,240
a tool behind many popular apps that you


5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,950
might be using today like the s code


6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,019
slack and discord just to name a few on


7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,730
the front end you build UIs just like


8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,350
you would for a browser-based web app


9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,789
and you can bring along to our favorite


10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,980
frameworks but an electron you also have


11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,810
access to note J s and that means you


12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,550
can access low-level API s that you


13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,140
don't normally have access to in a


14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,150
sandbox browser like the file system


15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,890
electron combines the front end and back


16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,720
end technologies and provides a bunch of


17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,369
other tools to work with native menus


18
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,960
the system tray and so on


19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,219
let's go ahead and build a desktop app


20
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,380
now run NPM in it in an empty directory


21
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,480
and install electron then create a


22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,700
main.js file and set that as the main


23
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,890
entry point into your app every electron


24
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,989
app has exactly one main process running


25
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,180
it manages the lifecycle of your app and


26
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,950
opens the windows that the end user will


27
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,140
see each window is its own independent


28
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,879
render process running with the chromium


29
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,620
web browser when your main app is ready


30
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,690
you can start a new render process by


31
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,820
instantiating a browser window until the


32
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,399
window to load a regular HTML file it


33
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,140
will render the HTML CSS and JavaScript


34
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,420
but do so in a native window and give


35
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,460
you access to low-level api is to build


36
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,290
a true desktop experience create an


37
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,330
index.html file and put whatever code


38
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,130
you want inside of it but notice how i'm


39
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,869
accessing note Global's directly in my


40
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,820
HTML that's not something you can do in


41
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,770
a normal web browser an electron gives


42
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,479
you control over the operating system UI


43
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,729
as well for example add your own icon


44
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,560
and controls to the system tray with


45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,390
just a few lines of code now after you


46
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,860
build something awesome you can package


47
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,020
it for multiple operating systems from a


48
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,640
single codebase tools like electron


49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,619
packager or forage can handle the entire


50
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,240
distribution process for you with a


51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,250
single command this has been electron in


52
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,290
100 seconds stay tuned for a full


53
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,270
electron project in a few days and make


54
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,680
sure to hit the like button if you want


55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,000
to see more short videos like this


56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,009
thanks for watching and I will see you


57
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,270
