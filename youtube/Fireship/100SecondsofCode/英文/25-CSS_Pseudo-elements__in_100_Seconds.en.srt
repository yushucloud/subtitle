1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,250
pseudo elements there's more to your


2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,230
HTML than meets the eye there are parts


3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,850
of the UI that you can style with CSS


4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,470
that don't actually exist in your HTML


5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,809
markup take for example a form input


6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,460
that has some placeholder text the


7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,110
placeholder value is defined as an


8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,880
attribute on the element so how do we


9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,770
get ahold of the placeholder to style it


10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,750
the answer is we target a pseudo element


11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,699
in our CSS they always have a double


12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,470
colon to distinguish them from pseudo


13
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,570
classes the difference is that a pseudo


14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,490
element represents an actual part of the


15
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,680
Dom whereas a pseudo class represents


16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,390
the state of an element based on the


17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,859
user's interaction with it pseudo


18
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,270
elements can make your code much more


19
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,160
efficient take for example this HTML


20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,110
where the first letter in each paragraph


21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,030
is being wrapped in a span so it can be


22
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,070
styled a far more efficient way to solve


23
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,600
this problem is by targeting the first


24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,610
letter on the paragraph element the end


25
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,739
result is much cleaner semantic HTML


26
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,629
that's cool but by far the most powerful


27
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,550
pseudo elements are before and after


28
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,250
many but not all HTML elements can have


29
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,440
content inserted before or after their


30
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,420
inner content handled entirely from your


31
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,550
CSS code for example we can target


32
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,620
before and provide an empty string as


33
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,270
the content property now that we've


34
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,710
targeted this element you'll notice that


35
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,390
it shows up in the browser's inspector


36
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,070
we can style this element as if it were


37
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,260
an empty span or div in our HTML and


38
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,520
that can be very useful for creating


39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
advanced animations without polluting


40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,540
your HTML markup imagine we have a big


41
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,580
unordered list and before each list item


42
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,619
we have an emoji character instead of


43
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,270
duplicating it in the markup we can


44
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,220
simply add it as the content property to


45
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,259
the before selector and once again we're


46
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,369
left with code that is far more


47
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,170
maintainable there's a few other pseudo


48
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,040
elements that you should know about


49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,049
selection allows you to change the


50
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,030
background and color of highlighted text


51
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,680
in some browsers like chrome but not


52
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,600
Firefox you can customize the scroll bar


53
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,640
on scrollable elements before using the


54
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,170
pseudo element always check for browser


55
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,060
compatibility ones like spelling error


56
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,380
might sound cool but they don't really


57
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,149
have any browser support yet this has


58
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,310
been pseudo elements in 100 seconds make


59
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,899
sure to also check out pseudo classes


60
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,939
thanks for watching and I will see you


61
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,940
in the next one


62
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,000
you
