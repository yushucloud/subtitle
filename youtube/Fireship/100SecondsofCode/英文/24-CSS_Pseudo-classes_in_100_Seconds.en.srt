1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,909
pseudo-class a way to style an element


2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,560
based on a change to its state for


3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,359
example when you hover over a button in


4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,130
the browser it automatically adds this


5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,110
hover keyword to the selector when


6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,580
working with pseudo classes it can be


7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,170
useful to go into the browser inspector


8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,820
and force the state on the element


9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,230
you're targeting there are a bunch of


10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,670
different pseudo classes out there like


11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,619
focus when the user is actively using a


12
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,779
form input or disabled when a button has


13
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,400
the disabled attribute set to true


14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,619
pseudo classes are also useful when


15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,480
working with a collection of elements we


16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,250
can easily target the first or last


17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,960
element in the list relative to its


18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,579
other siblings at this level by


19
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,170
targeting in the first child or last


20
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,090
child pseudo classes if we want to be


21
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,250
more specific we can use last of type so


22
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,379
it only targets this type of element but


23
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:41,879
what if we want the second third or


24
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,590
fourth element in that case we can use


25
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,780
nth child and pass an argument for the


26
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,700
element that we want to grab or instead


27
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,170
of a specific number we might want to


28
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,660
use odd or even or maybe we want to grab


29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,670
every fifth element in the list multiply


30
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,219
5 by n to get every 5th element like 5


31
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,500
10 15 and so on you can also use


32
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,180
addition and subtraction here to create


33
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,739
any kind of pattern you want now


34
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,359
sometimes you might select something in


35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,280
your CSS but what you actually want to


36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,290
style is everything else for that we


37
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,299
have the non pseudo class which performs


38
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,340
negation notice how when we hover over


39
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,080
an element in this list all the other


40
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,970
elements are styled but not the actual


41
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,500
element that we're hovering over that's


42
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,060
because we're targeting all the elements


43
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,890
that are not hovered pseudo selectors


44
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,360
are especially powerful when working


45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,549
with forms one of my favorites is focus


46
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,619
within which allows a parent element to


47
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,570
see if one of its children has focus and


48
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,220
that's especially useful if you have


49
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,049
something like a drop-down menu and once


50
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,670
you keep it open after the user has


51
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,290
clicked a button if you're building a


52
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,549
web app with an international audience


53
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,990
you might want to know about fileting


54
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,119
selector use it to apply custom styles


55
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,920
to any element that has a Lang attribute


56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,689
you can use it to make all of your Dutch


57
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,820
text orange or combine it with int child


58
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,710
to make your German text black red and


59
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,810
yellow this has been pseudo classes and
