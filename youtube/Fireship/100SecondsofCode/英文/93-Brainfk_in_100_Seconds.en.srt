1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
brain a minimal esoteric


2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
programming language designed to make


3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,839
your brain hurt it's turing complete but


4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,839
not designed to build actual software


5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,360
it's more like a work of art that


6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,120
challenges the status quo it was created


7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,759
in 1993 by swiss physics student urban


8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,280
mueller where the goal was to create a


9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
language with the smallest possible


10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,279
compiler it was built for the amiga 2.0


11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,199
operating system and the compiler weighs


12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,080
in at under 200 bytes a brain program


13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,840
starts with a 30 000 byte one


14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,439
dimensional array all values are


15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,199
initialized to zero then it provides a


16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
movable pointer that you can manipulate


17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
with eight different commands use angle


18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,719
brackets to move the pointer left or


19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
right by one cell at a time then


20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
increment or decrement the value in a


21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,200
cell using plus or minus use a period to


22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,879
output the byte at the pointer's current


23
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
location or use a comma to accept input


24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
and store it at the pointer's current


25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
location and finally use opening and


26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,360
closing brackets to create a loop notice


27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,120
how brain fog doesn't require silly


28
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
things like variables functions and


29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,879
classes to get started with brain


30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
delete your operating system and install


31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,920
amiga os then create a file ending in bf


32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
which stands for brain fog any


33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,040
characters that are not the aid i


34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
mentioned previously will be ignored as


35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
a comment at this point we have an array


36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
with thirty thousand eight bit numbers


37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,119
all set to 0. to say hi mom we'll need


38
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,119
to set each number to its corresponding


39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
ascii character we can increment the


40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,640
first cell then enter a loop with an


41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
opening bracket for each iteration of


42
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,159
the loop we'll decrement that current


43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,560
cell by 5 then use an angle bracket to


44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
move one cell to the right we'll


45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,759
increment that cell by three then move


46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,600
back to the left and close the loop the


47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
loop will continue until the original


48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
cell goes back to zero at which point it


49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,759
will exit we now have a value of 103 at


50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,600
index one we can move the pointer to it


51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
increment it to 104 then use a period to


52
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,079
output it that corresponds to the letter


53
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
h and ascii we can increment it again to


54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,560
get 105 which corresponds to the letter


55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,159
i now we continue this process of


56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
manipulating memory like caveman until


57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,520
we output all the characters that we


58
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,040
need now to run your code use


59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
right-click copy and paste it into one


60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,799
of the many online interpreters


61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
congratulations you just said hi to your


62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,640
mom and brain this has been brain
