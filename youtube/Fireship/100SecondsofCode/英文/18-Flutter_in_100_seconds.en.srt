00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
flutter a UI framework for building apps


2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,830
on iOS Android the web and desktop at


3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,540
its core flutter combines a high


4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,189
performance graphics engine with the


5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,200
dart programming language in development


6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,940
dart provides full type safety and


7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,950
stateful hot reload to help you build


8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,379
reliable apps quickly in production dart


9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,090
compiles to native machine code which


10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,500
means your graphics will render


11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,779
beautifully on any platform install


12
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,460
flutter then run flutter create to


13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,350
create a new project now open the main


14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,060
dart file this is where you build your


15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,460
app the UI is laid out as a tree of


16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,840
widgets and the framework provides


17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,730
hundreds of pre-built widgets to handle


18
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,440
things like animations scrolling


19
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,630
responsive layout and more you can build


20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,160
your own widget by extending the


21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,020
stateless widget class you then define


22
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,969
your UI by overriding its build method


23
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,770
now it's important to understand that


24
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,780
everything in flutter is a widget this


25
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,340
method returns a widget and it's


26
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,780
children return widgets and their


27
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,430
children return widgets giving us an


28
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,410
expressive declarative UI structure


29
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,030
which you can easily Traverse using


30
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,370
flutters awesome tool whenever the input


31
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,350
data to this widget changes flutter will


32
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,090
rebuild the UI by calling your build


33
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,770
method stateless widgets are immutable


34
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,899
and don't have any internal data when


35
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,250
you have an interactive widgets where


36
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,810
the internal data might change based on


37
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,820
user input you can extend a stateful


38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,799
widget properties defined on this class


39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,930
can be reactive for example we might


40
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,909
have a counter that starts at zero then


41
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,350
in our build method we have one of


42
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,939
flutters built-in buttons that cause a


43
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,530
function whenever it's pressed it


44
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,360
increments the counter by coin set state


45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,710
which tells the framework that the


46
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,630
widgets data has changed causing the UI


47
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,640
to re-render with the latest data you


48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,869
can now play with this app on a real


49
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,640
device using the flutter run command


50
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,380
that's cool and all but let's make some


51
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,150
changes we'll go back to our source code


52
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,680
and Center the button on the middle of


53
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,509
the screen instead of writing code just


54
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,009
click on the button and hit control


55
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,689
shift R then wrap your button with a


56
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,520
center widget next change the color of


57
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,810
the button and notice how flutter


58
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,640
previews that color directly in your IDE


59
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,009
now too hot reload the app simply type


60
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,810
or into the command line it only took a


61
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,490
few milliseconds to build a new version


62
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,079
of our app and notice how the state of


63
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,820
the counter was unchanged that's what I


64
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,409
like to call an awesome developer


65
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,869
experience this has been flutter in 100


66
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,310
seconds if you want to learn more check


67
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,229
out my newly updated flutter fire based


68
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,030
course on fire ship i/o thanks for


69
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,829
watching and I will see you in the next


70
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,580
