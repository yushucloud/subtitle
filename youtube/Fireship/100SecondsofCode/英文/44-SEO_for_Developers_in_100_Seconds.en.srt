1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,839
the first rule of search engine


2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,120
optimization is


3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,359
create really good content the second


4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,080
rule of search engine optimization is


5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,240
create really good content if human


6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,759
beings don't want to engage with your


7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,519
content then google doesn't want to


8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,000
either


9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,759
we live in the age of machine learning


10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,520
and quantum computing you can't just


11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,199
stuff a bunch of keywords into a page


12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,320
and expect to do well


13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,840
when google first came about in the late


14
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
90s it was based on an algorithm called


15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
pagerank which weighted relevance and


16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,720
search ranking


17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
based on the number of inbound links


18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
that a site had people quickly learned


19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
how to exploit the algorithm


20
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,360
by spamming backlinks all over the


21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
internet to increase the site's page


22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,600
rank


23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
because a high ranking in google can


24
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
literally be worth millions of dollars


25
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,440
it brought us an entire industry of seo


26
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,079
experts


27
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,520
the good guys wear white hats the


28
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
hackers wear black hats but the most


29
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
effective ones wear grey hats but some


30
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,520
say


31
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
it's a dying industry y'all want to see


32
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
a dead body because it's becoming harder


33
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
and harder to manipulate google's


34
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,280
technology


35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
there are over 200 factors that go into


36
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,320
a site's ranking


37
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
that are geared mostly towards how


38
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
useful a user found your site did they


39
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
immediately bounce by clicking the back


40
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,840
button


41
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,520
or did they dwell on the page for a long


42
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,040
time and click other links


43
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
absorbing all kinds of useful content


44
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
content is king


45
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
but the third rule of seo is to render


46
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
html that can be reliably understood by


47
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
bots your main content


48
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,520
goes inside the body tags when google


49
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,400
crawls your site


50
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,799
it will use semantic html elements to


51
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
understand the content on the page


52
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
you might put your main content in an


53
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,080
article tag then put your most important


54
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
keywords and headings or h tags to


55
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,840
signal what your page is about


56
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,680
furthermore your html should be


57
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,759
accessible use alt tags and images


58
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
and aria tags where needed to make your


59
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
site usable on assistive devices


60
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
in the head of the document we have


61
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,200
metadata that's not directly shown to


62
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,079
the end user


63
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
but bots can use this data to further


64
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
understand the page and format the


65
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,360
actual appearance of your search engine


66
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,840
listing


67
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,920
the fourth rule of seo is to get your


68
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,159
fully rendered html loaded fast


69
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,240
if you have megabytes of blocking images


70
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
styles and javascript


71
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
both users and bots will pass on your


72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,439
site but going fast


73
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,119
is easier said than done that's why


74
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,439
today we're going beyond 100 seconds to


75
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
look at the many different strategies we


76
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
have to render html and how they impact


77
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
search engine optimization if you're new


78
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,959
here like and subscribe


79
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,879
and today i have a big announcement my


80
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
full next js firebase course


81
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,560
is now available if your goal is to


82
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
build a highly interactive web app


83
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,760
that is also fully search engine


84
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,280
friendly then you'll definitely want to


85
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,319
check out this course


86
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,080
now the four most important rules for


87
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,599
seo in my opinion


88
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
are create awesome content create


89
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
awesome content render properly


90
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
formatted html


91
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,959
and load your html quickly the first two


92
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,319
rules are very subjective


93
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,560
and depend entirely on your audience but


94
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,440
the general goal


95
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
is that when someone clicks on a link to


96
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
your site from a search engine ranking


97
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,599
page


98
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,200
they should engage with your site as


99
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
long as possible there are a few metrics


100
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
that you'll want to be aware of here


101
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
the first one is the click-through rate


102
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
or ctr


103
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,319
that defines how likely a user is to


104
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,519
click on your link


105
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,120
when displayed in a search engine


106
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
ranking page or serp


107
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
the higher the ctr the better and that


108
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
usually means you have a very relevant


109
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,840
title and description


110
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
now if a user clicks on your link and


111
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
then immediately clicks the back button


112
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
that's called a bounce and the higher


113
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,879
your bounce rate is the less likely your


114
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,879
site is to rank well in the long term


115
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
because apparently the content on the


116
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
page is not very relevant if the user


117
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,599
does stay on the page


118
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,680
google will keep track of the dwell time


119
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
which is the amount of time they spend


120
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,800
there before clicking back to the search


121
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,360
results


122
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,760
the longer the dwell time the better but


123
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
the best possible thing that can happen


124
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
is that the user never clicks back their


125
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
session will last forever


126
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,840
and they'll never need to go to another


127
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
website ever again that doesn't happen


128
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,720
very often


129
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
so what you keep track of is the average


130
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,760
session duration


131
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
and the average number of pages viewed


132
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
per session these are metrics that you


133
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,879
want to maximize


134
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
there's no absolute rule for creating


135
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
engaging content


136
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
but the first thing the user sees should


137
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
hook them in to want to read more


138
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
if you look at something like buzzfeed


139
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
all you have to do is put an animated


140
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
gif at the top then maybe a few more in


141
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,360
the body


142
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,200
and you should be good let's move on to


143
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
rule three where we talk about the


144
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
actual structure of the html


145
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
i'll be using my site fireship io as an


146
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,000
example


147
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
on a lesson or article page you can


148
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
right click and hit inspect element


149
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
or hit control shift i this will bring


150
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,879
up the elements tab in chrome devtools


151
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,799
showing you the fully rendered html


152
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,319
markup we have a head


153
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,079
and a body let's go ahead and open up


154
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,919
the body find the main element


155
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,519
then inside the main element you'll


156
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,359
notice we have an article an article


157
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,040
element has semantic meaning and


158
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
although it will never be seen by the


159
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,320
end user it tells the search engine


160
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
here is the main content of the page in


161
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,360
addition


162
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
you'll notice a couple of extra


163
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
attributes here one is item scope


164
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,040
and the other is an item type as a


165
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,080
schema.org


166
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
article now it's totally optional and


167
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,040
whether or not it will improve your


168
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
search engine ranking is debatable but


169
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,000
what schema.org


170
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
allows you to do is define a bunch of


171
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
metadata about the actual content on


172
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,960
your page


173
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
making it easier for search engines to


174
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
interpret it's especially powerful


175
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
if your content is something like a


176
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
recipe or a star review


177
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
because google can then take the schema


178
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,479
data and format it properly in a serp


179
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:58,960
page


180
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
now in this case we have a bunch of


181
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
metadata that make up an article


182
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
and one thing that is known to improve


183
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
search ranking is when an article is


184
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
written by a known author


185
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,039
further down the html tree here you'll


186
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
notice we have an item prop of author


187
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
which points to the authors page that


188
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
link goes to another page on fireship io


189
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
and on that page we also have an article


190
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
element this time with an item type of a


191
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,360
schema.org


192
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
author along with a bunch of links that


193
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
point to authoritative sites for that


194
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,840
author


195
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
outbound links on a page are really


196
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,280
important because they further signal


197
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
what the page is about


198
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
in this case google will first crawl the


199
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
article then crawl the authors page


200
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
then crawl these other sites to


201
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
understand who that author is a good


202
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,800
strategy


203
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
is to use outbound links to other really


204
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
good sites that are related to the


205
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,080
content on a given page


206
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
now in addition to schema.org there's


207
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
other ways you can add metadata to your


208
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,880
content


209
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
and this can be very important for seo


210
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
and also accessibility


211
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,240
one of the most fundamental techniques


212
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,919
is to add an alt attribute


213
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,080
to images which is basically just some


214
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
text that describes the image


215
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
this metadata can be used by search


216
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
engines and also by screen readers for


217
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,479
those with disabilities


218
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
for other elements that are a little


219
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
more complicated like a progress bar for


220
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,039
example


221
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,199
you can use aria attributes which stand


222
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
for accessible rich


223
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,240
internet applications and they help


224
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
provide additional meaning


225
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
to highly interactive widgets on the


226
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
page at this point we've only been


227
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
looking in the body of the document


228
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
but the head of the document contains


229
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
all kinds of useful metadata for


230
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
seo most importantly this is where you


231
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,440
have the title


232
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
you should choose your title carefully


233
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,039
because it's displayed in a cert page


234
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,120
and will ultimately control your ctr


235
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
rating in addition to the title


236
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,880
you may also want to have meta tags here


237
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
which define things like the description


238
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
featured image author canonical url and


239
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,120
stuff like that


240
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
these meta tags are also essential if


241
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,880
you want your content to be shared on


242
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
social media sites like twitter or


243
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,280
facebook


244
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,880
when you post a hyperlink in social


245
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
media it fetches that page and looks for


246
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
the meta tags to understand what image


247
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
and title to display there


248
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,319
if you want to see how your site's doing


249
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
right now you can post a link into the


250
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
twitter card validator and it will tell


251
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,199
you whether or not it can use your


252
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,800
current meta tags


253
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
so that gives you some things to think


254
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,599
about when it comes to the actual


255
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
structure of your html


256
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
but the bigger question is how do you


257
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,440
render that html or in other words


258
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
what part of your tech stack is


259
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,039
responsible for generating the actual


260
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,080
html markup that is received by a bot or


261
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,800
end user


262
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,319
there are three fundamental ways to


263
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
render html the first one we'll look at


264
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,240
is client-side rendering if you're


265
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
building an app with something like


266
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,880
react or angular


267
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560
the default mode is client-side


268
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
rendering or a single page application


269
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,880
on the initial page load the user gets a


270
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
shell of html without any meaningful


271
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,680
content


272
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,919
the javascript code then bootstraps then


273
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
asynchronously fetches any additional


274
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
data needed for the ui


275
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
apps like this are great for


276
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,400
interactivity because it gives the end


277
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,919
user an app-like feel


278
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
similar to what you'd expect on ios or


279
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,199
android the problem


280
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
is that because the initial html is just


281
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
a shell search engines may have a hard


282
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,000
time


283
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
understanding and indexing it if you


284
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,319
take a link generated by javascript from


285
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,759
a single page application


286
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
and post it into twitter you'll only see


287
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
the initial shell you won't see any


288
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
additional meta tags that were generated


289
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
by javascript after the fact that's not


290
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,680
great for


291
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
social media but google as a search


292
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
engine is able to


293
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
index client rendered apps but the


294
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
reliability is questionable


295
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
and personally i wouldn't trust client


296
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
rendering if seo was a business critical


297
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,680
requirement


298
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
so another option is to pre-render or


299
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
statically generate html


300
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
in advance let's imagine your web app


301
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
has a hundred different routes or pages


302
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
instead of sending a shell down to the


303
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,800
user we could generate all the html for


304
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,479
those pages in advance


305
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,080
then upload the static files to a


306
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,839
storage bucket that could be cached on a


307
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,880
global cdn


308
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,719
so the first thing the user sees is


309
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,159
fully rendered content


310
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
then the javascript loads after that and


311
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,839
makes the page fully interactive


312
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
that's great for seo because bots get


313
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,360
fully rendered html


314
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,720
and they can easily interpret the


315
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
content on the page it's also highly


316
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,360
efficient


317
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,800
because if you're fetching data from a


318
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
database you only have to do that once


319
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
at build time then you can cache the


320
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,279
page on a cdn


321
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,880
and serve it to millions of people


322
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
without having to refetch your data


323
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
the trade-off with this approach though


324
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
is that the data in the pre-rendered


325
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
content can become stale which means


326
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
bots will be getting outdated


327
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
information until you rebuild and


328
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
redeploy the entire site


329
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
that's no big deal if you have a few


330
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
hundred pages that don't change very


331
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,480
often


332
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
but if you have millions of pages with


333
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
highly dynamic data then it doesn't


334
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,720
really scale


335
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,399
and that brings us to option number


336
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,160
three server side rendering


337
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
in this paradigm when the user makes a


338
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
request to a page the html is generated


339
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,519
on the server


340
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
this is also great for seo because bots


341
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
get fully rendered html on the initial


342
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,640
request


343
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
in addition the data will always be


344
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
fresh because you're making a new


345
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
request to the server each time


346
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,519
but the drawback here is that it's


347
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
generally less efficient you might be


348
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
fetching and rendering the same html


349
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,519
over and over again it is possible to do


350
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,640
server side caching


351
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
but that's not as efficient as edge


352
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,839
caching on a cdn


353
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,760
and will cost a lot more to operate at


354
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,279
scale and if things aren't cached


355
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,000
efficiently


356
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
that means a slower first time to


357
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,839
meaningful content which can negatively


358
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,320
impact


359
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
seo so basically between these three


360
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
methods we have a trade-off between data


361
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,440
freshness


362
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
performance and client-side


363
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
interactivity but what if there is a way


364
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
we could have our cake and eat it too


365
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
allow me to introduce you to incremental


366
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,160
static regeneration


367
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,959
this is the way this is a new form of


368
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
rendering available in the next js


369
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,360
framework


370
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
remember earlier i said the drawback


371
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
with static pages is that the data may


372
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
become stale and require a redeploy of


373
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
your site what isr does


374
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
is allow you to statically generate your


375
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
pages then rebuild and redeploy them on


376
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,120
the fly in the background as new


377
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
requests come into your site that means


378
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,800
you get all the performance benefits of


379
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,760
static pages


380
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
while ensuring that these pages always


381
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,880
contain fresh data


382
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,399
that eliminates all the trade-offs that


383
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
we've talked about but it's not without


384
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,800
a cost


385
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
deploying a static site is as easy as


386
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
uploading your files to a storage bucket


387
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,279
but incremental static regeneration


388
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
would require a more complex back-end


389
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,480
server deployment


390
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
for most of us that means paying for a


391
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
host that supports it


392
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
like versel but hosting anywhere else


393
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
will likely be much more painful


394
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
until more companies start adopting


395
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,959
these techniques now one very cool thing


396
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,440
going on


397
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
in the web development world right now


398
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
is that more frameworks like


399
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
next and angular are supporting hybrid


400
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
rendering that means you can implement


401
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,399
some routes as static pages


402
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,920
configure other routes to use full


403
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
server-side rendering while other routes


404
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,120
can be fully client rendered


405
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
so you're not pigeon-holed into just one


406
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,399
rendering technique you can pick and


407
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,720
choose what works best for a given page


408
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
and in my opinion that's the future of


409
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
full stack web development


410
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,360
i'm going to go ahead and wrap things up


411
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
there if you want to learn how to


412
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
implement a real hybrid rendered


413
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
application with next js consider


414
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
becoming a pro member at fireship io


415
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
you'll get access to the next course


416
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,480
along with a whole bunch of other pro


417
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,279
content


418
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
thanks for watching and i will see you


419
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
in the next one
