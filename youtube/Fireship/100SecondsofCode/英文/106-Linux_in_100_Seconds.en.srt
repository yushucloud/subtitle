1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Linux in open source operating system


2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,740
that makes it possible for humans to


3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,480
play with computers it was created in


4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,059
1991 by University of Helsinki student


5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,639
Linus Torvalds his goal was to create a


6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,259
free version of the Minix operating


7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,480
system which itself was based on Unix


8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,640
today it's used everywhere like the vast


9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,740
majority of web servers embedded apps


10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,420
like your smart TV mobile devices


11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,460
running Android and is by far the best


12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,320
choice for your personal computer with


13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,820
many different distros to choose from


14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,279
like Debian Arch and Fedora just to name


15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,040
a few just like Windows or Mac OS Linux


16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,320
is an operating system that manages a


17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,360
computer's memory and processes allowing


18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,100
Hardware to communicate with software


19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,200
when you fire up a Linux machine a


20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,760
bootloader will first put the system


21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,860
into memory at its core we have the


22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,719
kernel which is like a seed from which


23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,520
the rest of the operating system grows


24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,500
it's divided into multiple smaller


25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,600
subsystems like a process scheduler


26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,699
device drivers and a memory manager


27
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,320
they're exposed with a system call


28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,239
interface which itself is wrapped with


29
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,340
the c standard Library which provides an


30
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,800
API that user applications can interact


31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,480
with now beyond the kernel we have


32
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,820
applications that make the OS usable for


33
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,040
humans which are provided primarily via


34
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,380
the gnu project like a shell to interact


35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,700
with the kernel from the command line


36
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,979
windowing systems on desktop developer


37
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,479
utilities and countless other


38
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,880
applications to get started install your


39
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,680
favorite Linux distro open the terminal


40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,540
and notice how we're logged in as the


41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,580
root user on a specific Linux machine


42
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,680
currently we're in the home directory of


43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,479
the root user which is shortened to this


44
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,400
tilde character show its full name with


45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
the print working directory command now


46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,700
use change directories with a double


47
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,560
period to go to the root of the file


48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
system use the ls command to print all


49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,460
the subdirectories here these are your


50
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,439
critical system files let's go back home


51
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,200
with CD tilde now create a new file with


52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
touch then edit it from the terminal


53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,119
with a tool like VI Vim Nano or emacs in


54
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,860
Vim type Ida insert write your


55
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,560
screenplay hit Escape then colon WQ to


56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
write it to the file system now use the


57
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,219
cat command to read the file if it's


58
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,439
really big use grep to find all the


59
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,479
lines in that file that contain in a


60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,280
search term or pattern if we want to see


61
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,140
how big that file is we can enter the


62
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,360
disk usage command every file has an


63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,099
owner and a set of permissions assigned


64
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:09,720
to it we can change the owner with the


65
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Chone command or its permissions with


66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,379
chamod now if your current user doesn't


67
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,000
have proper permissions you can put


68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,280
super user do in front of any command to


69
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
run it with elevated privileges to


70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,120
install new software on this machine we


71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,220
can use a package manager like Advanced


72
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,780
package tool which will retrieve the


73
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,400
code from the cloud and place it in the


74
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,260
proper location on your system we just


75
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,819
went through a bunch of commands let's


76
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,739
recap everything with history this has


77
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,080
been Linux in 100 seconds if you want to


78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
