1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,879
jquery by far the world's most popular


2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,799
javascript library being found on over


3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,720
80 percent of the world's top 1 million


4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,440
websites


5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,880
that's more than four times the adoption


6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,480
of angular react and view


7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
combined it was invented back in 2006 by


8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
john resig before most of today's junior


9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,560
developers were even born he originally


10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
wanted to call it jselect


11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,520
but all the domains were taken the


12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
popularity of jquery is driven by a


13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,119
fundamental need in the web development


14
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:23,519
market


15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
javascript is a total and we want to


16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,039
write less of it furthermore


17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,960
back in o6 browsers had a bunch of


18
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
interop issues jquery provided a single


19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,360
api to handle the edge cases across


20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,399
multiple browsers


21
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,000
it's so good in fact that browser


22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
vendors of today have standardized many


23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
of its features and ship them as native


24
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,239
apis


25
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,680
you can install it by finding the source


26
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,520
code on the website right click to copy


27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
it then open dreamweaver and find all of


28
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
the html pages and paste it into a


29
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
script tag on each one your javascript


30
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
now has access to the mighty dollar sign


31
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,920
function


32
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,840
it takes a selector as its argument like


33
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
a tag name class or id it'll grab that


34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
html from the dom


35
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
allowing you to perform actions on it in


36
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
the html we have a list of items and we


37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,719
want to grab the first item in vanilla


38
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,320
js we'd have to use this ridiculously


39
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,680
long line of code to do so


40
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
in react we have to completely rewrite


41
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
our code into a component and implement


42
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
the confusing ref hook


43
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
with jquery we can use the dollar sign


44
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
to grab all the list items and then call


45
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,040
first to get the first one


46
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
it's easy and readable if we want to


47
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,479
animate it we can do that by simply


48
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
chaining a method to it and we can chain


49
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
more methods to it to register event


50
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,439
listeners and all kinds of other fun


51
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:23,840
stuff


52
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
declarative framework developers love to


53
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
fight each other about state management


54
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,479
don't make me swing on you bro


55
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,079
while jquery developers don't have this


56
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,680
problem because there's no data layer to


57
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
worry about instead you just start with


58
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,840
an object


59
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
shade methods to it and let the state


60
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
manage itself when it comes time to


61
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,479
extend jquery there's no need for


62
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,479
insanely complex web pack bundling or


63
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,520
npm packages


64
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
you can just extend its prototype with a


65
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
plugin and there's already a huge


66
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
ecosystem of plugins to get things done


67
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,880
quickly


68
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
as an added bonus once you've mastered


69
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,720
jquery you can jump into jquery mobile


70
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,079
and start building native apps for


71
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,439
windows phone and blackberry


72
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,119
developers of today sometimes make fun


73
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
of jquery but that's just the stuff you


74
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
have to deal with when you're the king


75
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
of javascript libraries


76
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
this has been the legend of jquery in


77
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
100 seconds if you want to see more


78
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,079
short videos like this hit the like


79
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
button and subscribe


80
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
thanks for watching and i will see you


81
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,840
in the next one
