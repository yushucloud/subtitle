1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
one million subscribers a youtube


2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,919
milestone i never expected to reach but


3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,680
here's the story of how i got here in


4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,320
2017 i started the channel with no video


5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,639
editing skills and zero expectations i


6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
hated the sound of my own voice and have


7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,759
been told i have the personality of a


8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,440
carrot but i was like screw it i'm going


9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,039
to try youtube and probably fail and


10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,880
disappoint my mom again in the process i


11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
found there was a need for developer


12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
content around angular and firebase so i


13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
created some really bad videos that were


14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
very useful to this highly specialized


15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
audience welcome to angularfirebase you


16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,880
create a new app with the angular cli


17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
then these files are going to be here by


18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,480
default i even remember my very first


19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
comment that motivated me to keep


20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,840
pushing forward in the early game the


21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
key is to find a specialized unmet need


22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
in the market then create the useful


23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
educational content that audience is


24
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,879
looking for if you're consistent


25
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,719
uploading a new video say once a week


26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,399
that should take you to about 10 000


27
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,480
subscribers in about a year or so but


28
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,399
then you'll hit a ceiling by the mid


29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,480
game my video editing skills were much


30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
improved to grow further i created


31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,320
videos targeted at a wider audience my


32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
first real banger was firebase basics my


33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
philosophy has always been to make the


34
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,479
next video better than the last one it


35
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,400
takes a lot of time and experimentation


36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
to really optimize the content for what


37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
your audience is looking for listen to


38
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
feedback and give the audience what they


39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
want like i don't show my face in my


40
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
videos because my handsomeness is


41
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
distracting and it forces me to find


42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
useful graphics that actually represent


43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,040
what i'm talking about what you don't


44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
want to do is copy somebody else not


45
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,240
only will that eat away at your soul but


46
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
in order to grow on youtube you really


47
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,119
need to find the thing that makes you


48
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,640
unique to reach 100k subscribers it took


49
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,360
675 days and 150 uploads the late game


50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
is where things get difficult you'll be


51
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
extremely burned out at this point and


52
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
10xing the road to 100k might seem


53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
impossible to keep growing though the


54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
formula is simple keep uploading and


55
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
keep getting better at this point i


56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
started taking a more scientific


57
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
approach by optimizing two metrics the


58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
click-through rating and the watch time


59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
to optimize clicks you need a good title


60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
and thumbnail that's more of an art form


61
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
than anything you need to know what your


62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,560
audience wants and how to surprise them


63
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,920
with something creative for me that


64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,600
comes easy because i also have a lot of


65
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,439
fun and get really excited about every


66
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
video i create for watch time i have a


67
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,200
formula with three ingredients most


68
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
importantly the content needs to be


69
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
educational and useful the second


70
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
ingredient is storytelling there are so


71
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
many interesting stories to tell about


72
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
the history of software and the people


73
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
behind it the final ingredient is humor


74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
i can tell jokes that are actually


75
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
encoded messages of things that i


76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
couldn't say otherwise without sounding


77
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
like a total dick this has been how to


78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
get 1 million youtube subscribers in 100


79
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
seconds and i want to send a huge thank


80
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760

81
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440

more to me than you'll ever know i've


83
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,720
learned so much met amazing people and


84
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,239
have the rare privilege of actually


85
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,080
enjoying what i do for work and now we


86
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
get to start down the road to 10 million

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,440
i'm not sure how we'll get there yet but


88
