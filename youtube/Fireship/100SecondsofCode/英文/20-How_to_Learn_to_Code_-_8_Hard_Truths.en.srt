1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
everybody needs to learn to code coding


2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,760
is the new literacy if you can't code


3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,920
you'll soon become obsolete plus coding


4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,600
is easy so you really have no excuse


5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,800
these are all statements that are not


6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,400
true but i've been told that fear-based


7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
sales tactics will scare you into


8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,280
subscribing to my youtube channel in


9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,880
today's video i'm going to share a


10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
variety of practical techniques that


11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,840
have helped me learn to code because


12
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
learning in and of itself is a skill and


13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,119
if you want to be a software engineer


14
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,480
you'll need to learn new things all the


15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
time many moons ago i didn't know how to


16
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
code i wanted to learn because i hated


17
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,080
my low paying miserable job and wanted


18
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,199
to build some kind of app on the


19
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,720
internet that would allow me to break


20
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,320
out and start my own business i figured


21
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,840
i wasn't smart enough to code but you


22
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
only live once so i bought a giant book


23
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
about php and mysql and sure enough i


24
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
wasn't smart enough to code and those


25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,879
toilets weren't going to clean


26
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,719
themselves i went back to my crappy job


27
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
and forgot about it luckily a little


28
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,160
while later my family needed a website


29
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,520
so i figured i was at least smart enough


30
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
to learn html and somehow a few months


31
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
later i figured out how to ship my first


32
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,879
website the important thing to recognize


33
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,640
when learning to code is that hard work


34
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,399
is more valuable than talent talon is


35
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,000
great if you have it and there are 10x


36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
developers out there where things just


37
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,879
click on a much higher level but


38
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,800
programming is a skill very similar to


39
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
playing a musical instrument or juggling


40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
for most people you totally suck at


41
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,680
first then you feel like a genius when


42
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
you code your first program then you


43
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,560
realize you totally suck again and this


44
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
pattern goes on and on forever in an


45
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
infinite loop learning is supposed to be


46
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
painful in fact i believe that you need


47
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,759
pain to grow when learning a guitar you


48
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,960
need to put your fingertips through a


49
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
lot of pain before you build calluses in


50
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
programming you'll have to bang your


51
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
head against the keyboard a bunch of


52
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,880
times until you figure out how to make


53
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
these error messages go away so if you


54
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
don't have talent be prepared to embrace


55
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,079
the hard work now as you learn you might


56
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,600
be wondering which programming language


57
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
should i start with the truth is that it


58
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,640
doesn't matter as long as you get really


59
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
good at one of them the thing about


60
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
programming is that there's so much to


61
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,040
learn you are never going to retain at


62
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
all i used to be a really good ruby


63
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,920
programmer but at this point i've


64
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
forgotten almost everything about it and


65
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
that's no big deal because memorizing


66
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
syntax doesn't really matter the thing


67
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
you really want to learn and retain are


68
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
programming patterns essentially


69
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,600
everything you do in programming is


70
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
problem solving the idea is to create a


71
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
repertoire of tools in your brain that


72
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
you can then use to solve virtually any


73
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
problem in any language for example if


74
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
you need to loop over something but


75
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
you've never used pearl before you still


76
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
understand the trade-offs between a for


77
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
loop while loop and recursion this is


78
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,920
the exact reason that when you go to a


79
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
technical interview they usually don't


80
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,959
care which language you use they just


81
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,319
want to see that you know how to solve


82
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
problems and in some cases they may only


83
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,440
have you write pseudocode on a


84
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
whiteboard to analyze your


85
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
problem-solving skills so in learning i


86
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
would recommend trying out a few


87
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,040
different languages and learn the one


88
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
that feels most natural to you for most


89
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,959
people i think python is ideal because


90
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,879
it has a minimal syntax is extremely


91
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,720
popular and is also just a very useful


92
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,239
language to know in general but


93
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
javascript go kotlin and swift are also


94
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,640
good languages to start with but again


95
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
it's about becoming a problem solver not


96
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,239
about memorizing syntax and that begs


97
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,760
the question how do i become a good


98
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
problem solver the answer is go solve a


99
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
bunch of problems turn off youtube and


100
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,200
go write some code will you ever learn


101
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
to play guitar by watching other people


102
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,959
on youtube play guitar the answer is no


103
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
you also need to be playing the guitar


104
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
along with them books and tutorials are


105
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
great sign up for fireship pro but


106
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
they're utterly useless if you're not


107
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
coding along with them in my tutorials i


108
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,959
try to set you up with something cool to


109
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
build so you can go have fun and fail on


110
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,239
your own you can build things based on


111
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
tutorials you can try to build your own


112
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
stuff you can do coding challenges


113
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
participate in hackathons and all kinds


114
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
of other stuff if you're serious you


115
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
should be coding at least a couple hours


116
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
every day there's a reason they require


117
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
pilots to have a certain number of


118
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,120
flying hours experience matters more


119
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,959
than anything else and luckily for you


120
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
to get time in the saddle all you have


121
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
to do is sit on your ass in front of


122
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,879
your computer screen and hit the


123
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
keyboard until something cool happens


124
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,159
speaking of which sitting on your ass in


125
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,760
front of a computer screen is not


126
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
natural or healthy and that means you


127
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
need to work extra hard in this line of


128
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
work to protect your health both


129
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
mentally and physically that's why i


130
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,000
prefer to eat at arby's the most trusted


131
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
name and nutrition i also get plenty of


132
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,000
sunshine and exercise to offset the time


133
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
i spend banging my head against the


134
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,799
keyboard in my mom's dark windowless


135
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,480
basement if your health is not optimal


136
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
you won't learn as efficiently and


137
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
there's no activity in the world that's


138
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
worth sacrificing your health over now


139
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,959
let's switch gears and talk about a


140
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
physicist named richard feynman he's a


141
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
nobel prize winner known for many things


142
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,640
one of which is his learning technique


143
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,319
it goes like this choose a concept you


144
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,080
want to learn about explain it to a 12


145
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
year old reflect refine simplify then


146
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
organize and review in other words you


147
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
learn most efficiently when you try to


148
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,439
teach the very thing you're learning i


149
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
can tell you right now that i've learned


150
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,480
way more about programming from running


151
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
this youtube channel than i ever did


152
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,680
working all by myself now that doesn't


153
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
mean that everybody needs to go and


154
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
start a youtube channel all you have to


155
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
do is pretend to teach something but if


156
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,680
you can create valuable content out of


157
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
it like a video or blog post that's even


158
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
better or if you already have a job


159
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
you'll find that you learn a lot just by


160
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
mentoring other people or if you don't


161
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,759
have a job you can join programming


162
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,520
slack or discord channels and help


163
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,199
people out there or answer questions on


164
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
stack overflow helping others feels good


165
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,479
and it forces you to be extremely


166
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,080
precise about what you actually know


167
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
here's how it might look for a


168
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,520
programmer choose a topic like i want to


169
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
program a video game do some research


170
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
and experimenting and write a summary


171
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
explaining the technology to a 12 year


172
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,880
old then go and build something and get


173
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
to a full working demo as quickly as


174
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
possible it doesn't need to be perfect


175
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
because in the final step you'll go back


176
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,320
and refactor and simplify and find ways


177
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
to improve your process and get feedback


178
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
from someone more experienced than you


179
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
if possible so approach it like a


180
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
teacher even though you have no idea


181
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,479
what you're currently teaching now i


182
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
said something very subtle but very


183
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
important and that is to build a full


184
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
working demo as quickly as possible


185
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
learning is supposed to be painful but


186
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,880
there also needs to be some kind of


187
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
reward for that pain and the more


188
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,919
quickly you can get to those rewards the


189
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,680
better because what you want is a


190
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
positive feedback loop that basically


191
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
makes you addicted to coding there are


192
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
ways we can hack the most primitive


193
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
parts of our brain what i do almost


194
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,360
every day before i go to bed is write


195
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
down a few small goals that i want to


196
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
achieve the next day the important thing


197
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
is that the goals are achievable because


198
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,840
then writing a check mark next to that


199
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
goal feels good when good things happen


200
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
your brain releases dopamine and you


201
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,880
want to try to find activities that


202
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,639
after hard work give you that dopamine


203
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,000
hit because otherwise you'll have a


204
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
negative feedback loop in which case


205
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
you're going to absolutely hate coding


206
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,560
in no time that'd be like learning how


207
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
to press the strings on a guitar without


208
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
ever knowing how to play an actual song


209
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,240
the idea is to work hard and be rewarded


210
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,919
but you don't want to work too hard it's


211
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,520
extremely important especially for


212
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
programming to pace yourself and take


213
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,039
regular breaks for most people that


214
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,400
likely means one or two hours of


215
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,160
programming followed by a nice long


216
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
break i remember in my early days being


217
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
absolutely determined to not let the


218
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
error messages win i'd go late into the


219
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,199
night stack overflowing every possible


220
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,039
combination of questions only to give up


221
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,240
and get a good night's sleep and then


222
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
come back and immediately solve the


223
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
problem in the morning and this isn't


224
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
unique to me it happens to everybody


225
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,319
because mental spacing is actually a


226
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
very important thing you can be mentally


227
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,919
exhausted while at the same time your


228
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,000
ego is saying you got this bro don't be


229
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
a loser but the reality is that the most


230
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,919
efficient thing to do is go outside get


231
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
some sunshine jump in a cold body of


232
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,520
water and get some sleep when you wake


233
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
up you'll be ready to crush it once


234
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,400
again now that you know how to learn to


235
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
code all you have to do is go to google


236
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
type in what you want to learn and let


237
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
it be your guide because that's


238
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,039
basically all you ever do as a software


239
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,240
engineer i'm going to go ahead and wrap


240
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
