1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,159
the programmer an offshoot of the great


2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,240
ape family closely related to chimps and


3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,160
gorillas distinguished by its minimal


4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,160
bipedal movement and ability to stare at


5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,760
a computer screen for the majority of


6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,599
its lifetime there's an estimated 30


7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,360
million specimens alive in the world


8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,599
today normal humans use stereotypes to


9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
help understand and generalize this


10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
unusual variant which experts estimate


11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,320
are about 99 accurate about 12 of the


12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
time in today's video we'll take a look


13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
at 10 different programmer stereotypes


14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
to find out which one you fall into


15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,519
first up we have the gear head this


16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,279
variant owns the bleeding edge version


17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,280
of everything like the latest m1 mac a


18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120
big ass curved monitor mechanical


19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
keyboard tesla in the garage ai


20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,480
generated synthetic meat in the fridge


21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
and a smart lock on the house to keep it


22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,680
all safe when programming he goes


23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
wherever the hype train takes him in 96


24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,640
it was java in o6 it was jquery in 2016


25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,719
it was graphql and in 2026 he'll be


26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,239
first in line at neural link to get a


27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,760
chip that can help him write blazingly


28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,120
fast code it doesn't matter what the


29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,199
tech does if it's trendy it belongs in


30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,039
the stack this stereotype may be true


31
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,800
sometimes but programming can actually


32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
push many people in the opposite


33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
direction the guy who works in tech but


34
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,320
hates text stereotype knows exactly how


35
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,400
unreliable and dangerous code can be


36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
like that the rac25 incident where a


37
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
little software bug accidentally killed


38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,360
some people by giving them a massive


39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,119
overdose of radiation this guy would


40
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,799
never buy a car that can be remotely


41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,400
summoned back to elon when you stop


42
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,840
paying the bill and he would definitely


43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,360
never put a smart lock on his house


44
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
because the nsa probably has backdoor


45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
access or at the very least there's an


46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
undiscovered exploit in its code if you


47
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,400
broke into his farmhouse you'd find a


48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
single monitor linux machine a flip


49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159
phone some gold bullion and a shotgun


50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,920
barrel pointed in your face


51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,759
the most stereotypical programmer though


52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
has to be the introvert he's a savant


53
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
who still sleeps in a car bed and his


54
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
vision of the ideal lifestyle is what


55
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,880
the rest of society calls quarantine


56
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
he's super good at math and can actually


57
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,240
program stuff without using google and


58
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
stack overflow but couldn't hold a


59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
conversation to save his life extroverts


60
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,240
like jobs use these nerds like woz to


61
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
get super rich this stereotype used to


62
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
be 100 true back when programming was


63
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,880
hard like pre-1990s but as programming


64
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,799
has become more mainstream it's led to a


65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,200
new paradigm the programmer this guy got


66
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
a computer science degree while mostly


67
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
partying with his frat in college


68
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
his name is usually chad and he has more


69
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
mating opportunities than the introvert


70
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,319
but it comes at a cost of reduced code


71
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,319
quality which he refuses to test because


72
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
test driven development is for losers


73
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,080
nah bro however he has better


74
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
communication skills than the introverts


75
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
which is annoying because i wish this


76
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,720
guy would stop talking to me eventually


77
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
he evolves into your manager where he


78
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,920
can torment you with code reviews and


79
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
team building exercises now so far in


80
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
this video i've been using a lot of


81
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
masculine pronouns that's because 95 of


82
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
my audience is male which is actually


83
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
pretty close to the real world


84
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,840
distribution today what you may not


85
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
realize though is that back in the day


86
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,280
women used to dominate the programming


87
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,040
space kathleen booth created the first


88
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,720
assembly language grace hopper created


89
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
the first compiler and margaret hamilton


90
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
led the team who wrote the code for the


91
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
apollo moonlander code that was so


92
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
flawless and perfectly executed that


93
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,959
some people think it's proof we didn't


94
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
actually go to the moon that was the


95
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
apex of code quality since that time


96
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,680
everything's gone downhill the next


97
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
specimen we'll look at is the influencer


98
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
or code fluencer his natural habitat is


99
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
not a code editor but rather a social


100
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,599
media platform most commonly twitter


101
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,280
after figuring out how to print hello


102
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
world in php he immediately rose to the


103
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
top of the dominance hierarchy in his


104
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,879
own mind now he makes the world a better


105
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,040
place by regurgitating code tips and hot


106
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
takes all day long and he just landed a


107
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
better paying job than you because he


108
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,840
mastered the art of virtue signaling and


109
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
that's what we call a good culture fit


110
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
another popular stereotype is the hacker


111
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
this guy's able to open up a terminal


112
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
connect to some remote mainframe and


113
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,120
break all of its security protocols one


114
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,200
by one with awesome fancy animations


115
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
between each step this stereotype is


116
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
what most people think programmers do


117
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,120
but is 100 manufactured by hollywood


118
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
real hacking is extremely tedious and


119
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
boring and is done primarily by the


120
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
people who have all the guns now a


121
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
stereotype that is actually real is the


122
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
10x developer this guy is an extremely


123
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,239
rare unicorn that can do the work of 10


124
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,000
other developers combined some say


125
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
they're a myth but i've seen developers


126
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
first hand who write code like durant


127
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
plays basketball or kasparov plays chess


128
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
there are people out there with a


129
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
natural problem-solving ability that


130
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
just goes far beyond the rest of the


131
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,319
population you'll know a 10x developer


132
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,519
when you see one because you'll feel


133
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,760
very incompetent and also very jealous


134
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,519
now i think the ideal stereotype for


135
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,439
most of us to fall into is the lazy


136
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,040
programmer to the outside world it


137
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
doesn't look like this guy does much he


138
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
sits at a computer all day hitting the


139
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
keyboard and if you glance at a screen


140
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,040
it looks like he's just copying and


141
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
pasting things from the internet what


142
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
he's actually doing though is building a


143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,519
million dollar side hustle so he can


144
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,600
retire in his 30s he also has a remote


145
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
job with a 400k salary but he eats ramen


146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
for dinner while sharing a crappy


147
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
apartment with four other dudes his


148
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
wardrobe is 50 swag from tech


149
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
conferences and 50 thinks his mom bought


150
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
him he leverages code to work smarter


151
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
and not harder now on the other end of


152
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
the spectrum we have the old jaded guy


153
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
he has long silver hair and a big white


154
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,840
beard he only codes in c not c plus plus


155
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
and definitely not any of the hipster


156
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
garbage that you're using in fact he


157
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
probably wrote the compiler for the


158
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
silly toy language that you're trying to


159
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
learn his depth of knowledge transcends


160
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
the normal apes idea of reality when he


161
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
discovered through psychedelics that


162
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
we're all just one entity that found a


163
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
hack in the universe to experience


164
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
itself in parallel with primate bodies


165
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
and computers are the tool that will


166
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
ultimately make us one again and that


167
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
concludes our presentation on programmer


168
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,479
stereotypes let me know which one you


169
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
fall into in the comments below thanks


170
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,000
for watching and i will see you in the


171
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,240
next one
