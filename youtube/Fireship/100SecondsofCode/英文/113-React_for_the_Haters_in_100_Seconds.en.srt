00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
react.js a half-baked functional ui


2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,720
library created at facebook that's used


3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
by millions of developers because it has


4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
a cool name and logo it was invented by


5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,719
mark zuckerberg in 2013. and that was a


6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,080
big mistake


7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,400
and it was my mistake and i'm sorry


8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,480
react is simple it's just javascript bro


9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,760
and that's why it gives you dozens of


10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,520
weird ways to solve the same problems


11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,880
like functional and class-based


12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
components hooks forward ref higher


13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,560
order components mix-ins render props


14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
suspense and so on it's credited as the


15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
first declarative ui library even though


16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
it took most of those ideas from


17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,160
angularjs its killer feature though is


18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,440
the fact that you can write pure


19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,040
functional code that is until you want


20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,640
to do anything useful in which case


21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,000
you'll need to write imper functions


22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
with state and effects the beauty of


23
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,200
this approach is that it makes simple


24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
things like reactive state much more


25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,239
complicated than they need to be and


26
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,440
that's what makes us feel like real


27
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
developers use effect is especially fun


28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,039
and was originally going to be called


29
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
use foot gun because it's a great way to


30
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,640
introduce infinite loops performance


31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
issues and bugs that you'll never be


32
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
able to figure out not to worry though


33
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,120
react is always evolving with


34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
revolutionary new features to monkey


35
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
patch all the weirdness nobody saw


36
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
coming on the previous release now even


37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,440
though it has an extremely high learning


38
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,280
curve react is a library and not a


39
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
framework and that means to build


40
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
something cool you'll need to find and


41
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
install hundreds of different packages


42
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,360
most of which were built by teenagers


43
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
who stopped maintaining them years ago


44
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
when they went off to college to learn a


45
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
real language like c to get started


46
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,840
create a new react app then open up


47
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,920
google to enter the gates of tutorial


48
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
hell notice how we start in strict mode


49
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,439
that's used to hide baggage from


50
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,880
previous versions of the framework i


51
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
mean library now in the code we pretend


52
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
we're doing functional programming by


53
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
writing our components as functions


54
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,920
classes are also possible but they are


55
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,759
literally the double instead we use


56
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,280
these hooks everywhere that do the same


57
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
classes do in a more magical


58
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,119
hipstery way templating is handled in


59
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,119
jsx it's a non-standard way to write


60
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,280
html which allows you to represent the


61
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,759
ui entirely in non-portable callback


62
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,000
hell now we can all agree to hate css


63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,439
but react will make you hate it even


64
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,200
more when you try to style something on


65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
your own luckily there are hundreds of


66
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
css and js libraries working on this


67
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
problem as we speak the extra complexity


68
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
is worth it though because react is


69
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
blazingly fast assuming you implemented


70
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
all the weird tricks flawlessly life is


71
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,920
about suffering it's not supposed to be


72
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
fun like spelt or fast like solid or


73
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
reliable like angular or all of the


74
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,119
above like view the only thing that


75
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
matters is react is the most popular and


76
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
that makes it undeniably the best just


77
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
like microsoft makes the best operating


78
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,640
system and mcdonald's makes the best


79
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
food this has been me destroying my


80
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
reputation with the react community in


81
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
100 seconds react has been the most


82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
influential library in front of web


83
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,879
development for the last decade


84
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,560
nothing's perfect but it got to where it


85
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,239
is today because it does a lot of things


86
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,760
right and for that it deserves our


87
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
respect thanks for watching and i will


88
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
see you in the next one
