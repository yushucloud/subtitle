00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
CSS grin a system for laying out items


2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,279
across a movable set of horizontal and


3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,440
vertical lines inside a grid we have


4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,330
invisible lines that divide columns and


5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,400
rows the space between two parallel grid


6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,620
lines is known as a grid track and the


7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,269
space between four lines is known as a


8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,730
grid area in your HTML start with a


9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,680
parent element to serve as your grid


10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,600
container then all of its children will


11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,789
automatically become grid items let's


12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:24,990
imagine we wanted to build a website


13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,390
with a holy grail layout in the HTML if


14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,130
we have a container with five elements


15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,539
inside we'll start by setting the


16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,880
containers display property to grid now


17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,739
open your app in Firefox to visualize


18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,290
the gridlines tracks and areas it helps


19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,820
to imagine your website as an Excel


20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,770
spreadsheet in each individual cell add


21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,719
a label that represents the element that


22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,100
should appear there each cell in the


23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,260
grid represents one fractional unit in


24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,210
the middle we have an advertisement the


25
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,280
main content and the sidebar then we


26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,660
have the top bar taking up three cells


27
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,430
on the top and a footer on the bottom


28
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,379
notice how this represents a three by


29
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,210
three grid and we can use this as the


30
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,980
value for the grid template areas


31
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,809
property now we need to tell the


32
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,609
children which grid area that they take


33
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,470
up we can do that by providing the name


34
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,479
to the grid area property that gives us


35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,979
the right layout but now we want to


36
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,439
adjust the size of the rows and columns


37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,820
currently each column is taking up one


38
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,979
third or one fractional unit of the


39
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,810
available space we can change the width


40
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,400
of the middle column by setting it to a


41
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,860
fixed pixel value or change the ratio by


42
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,990
giving it three fractional units


43
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,159
likewise we can change the height of


44
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,780
rows using the grid template rows


45
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,790
property if we want to add spacing


46
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,290
between our grid lines we can use the


47
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,180
great gap property and we can Center the


48
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,290
children vertically or horizontally


49
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,229
using justify items or line items and


50
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,119
make sure to check out the min Max and


51
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,189
repeat functions to avoid duplication on


52
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,619
larger grids this has been CSS grid and


53
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,990
100 seconds stay tuned for a full grid


54
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,909
