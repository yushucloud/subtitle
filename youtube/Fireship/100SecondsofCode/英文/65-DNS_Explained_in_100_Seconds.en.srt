1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,879
the domain name system or dns is like


2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,799
the phone book of the internet it maps


3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,320
human readable urls or host names like


4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,480
www.fireship.io


5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,719
to the ip address of the server that


6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,960
hosts that site when you type a url into


7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,599
the browser


8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
it makes a dns query to figure out which


9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,199
unique ip address


10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,520
is associated with that hostname first


11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
it'll attempt to look in the local


12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,119
browser or operating system cache


13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,880
but if the cache is empty then we need


14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
to look up the ip address in the phone


15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,480
book which is the job of a server


16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,200
known as the dns recursive resolver it's


17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,920
recursive


18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
because it needs to make multiple


19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
requests to other servers starting with


20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
the root name server which itself will


21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,360
respond with the address of a top level


22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,760
domain dns server which stores data


23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,520
about top level domains like


24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
com or dot io the resolver makes a


25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
request there which will respond with


26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,680
the ip address of the authoritative name


27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,239
server


28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,840
that's the final source of truth that


29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,920
contains the requested website's ip


30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
address that gets sent back down to the


31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,000
client


32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
and is cached for future use that sounds


33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,079
complicated but it all happens within a


34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,199
fraction of a second


35
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,720
you can think of it as a globally


36
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,560
distributed database that handles more


37
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
requests than any other database in the


38
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,720
world


39
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
when you register a domain name it's


40
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,000
handled by a registrar


41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,439
accredited by the non-profit


42
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
organization icann the record is then


43
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
maintained by a registry operator who


44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
stores your dns settings and propagates


45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:20,720
them to


46
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,799
other dns servers around the world as


47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,720
the registrant you'll be assigned a zone


48
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
file where you can configure


49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,240
the settings of your domain every zone


50
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,840
has a startup authority record


51
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
to tell other dns servers who's in


52
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
charge of that domain


53
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,799
but most importantly we have the a


54
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,240
record it means address


55
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
and maps a domain or subdomain to the ip


56
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
address of its host


57
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
in other cases though we may want to


58
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
forward a domain to another domain on


59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,320
the internet


60
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
instead of an ip address in which case a


61
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
canonical name or cname record would be


62
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,119
used


63
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
we have mx records for email and we can


64
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,600
store arbitrary data with text records


65
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,000
which is


66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
often used to communicate with third


67
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
parties to verify ownership of the


68
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
domain and finally we have the ns or


69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
name server record a url that the


70
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,079
internet can ping to find our ip address


71
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,520
and there's almost always two of them


72
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
for better reliability


73
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
