1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,320
java a boilerplate driven language


2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,919
designed for writing verbose


3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,319
object-oriented instant legacy code it


4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,000
came into being thanks to a relentless


5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
hype campaign by sun microsystems in the


6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,920
middle of the dot-com bubble it's kind


7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,280
of like the macaulay culkin of


8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,880
programming languages it was originally


9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,880
invented to create a better tv remote


10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
than it officially launched for public


11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
use in 1996 and nobody's bothered to


12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
update the website ever since regardless


13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
java has been running on 3 billion


14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
devices for the last 25 years most of


15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,720
which are blu-ray players its motto is


16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
right once run everywhere which


17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,920
developers know actually means write


18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,239
once debug everywhere remember the log4j


19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
fiasco you can blame java for that one


20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
still java has a great mascot a little


21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,079
one-eyed monster named duke and people


22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,520
love to hate it so much that it's


23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
inspired an entire class of programming


24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
languages designed to make java better


25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,520
like groovy closure scala and kotlin


26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,280
just to name a few unfortunately though


27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,440
there is no cure java also inspired


28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
javascript a language that has taken


29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
developers 25 years to make halfway


30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,199
decent and one time java even tried to


31
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,280
steal javascript's job with applets on


32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
the web luckily applet sucks so bad they


33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
made html css and javascript look like a


34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
good abstraction for building uis now


35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
when your company adopts java you'll


36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,439
also want to adopt oracle database so


37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
you can spend the next 20 years talking


38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,720
about migrating to postgres while paying


39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
an ungodly amount of money that will be


40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
directly reinvested into these awesome


41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,000
sailing yachts to get started set aside


42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
a few days to install the jdk jre and


43
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,000
jvm on your machine it's also


44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
recommended that you have a vertical


45
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
monitor to read the error logs that are


46
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
coming now before writing any code say


47
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
this with me public static void main


48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
string args public static void main


49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,360
string args now to say hello world


50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
create a class java forces you into


51
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
object oriented programming which means


52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
you'll want to read design patterns


53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
cover to cover before you go any further


54
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,079
now it's time for your public static


55
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,159
void main string args and then finally


56
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,360
system.out.printline with hello world as


57
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
you can see we get a lot more


58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
boilerplate than something like python


59
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
which is a feature and definitely not a


60
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,759
fundamental design flaw or anything


61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,280
you'll want to start by writing one


62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
giant bloated class then when your boss


63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
complains break it into a hierarchy of


64
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,280
deeply nested subclasses that will make


65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
it impossible to refactor the next step


66
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,439
is to ragequit from your job life is way


67
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
too short to be coding in java man and


68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,399
with that i think i've lost enough


69
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
subscribers for one video there are only


70
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
two kinds of languages the ones people


71
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
complain about and the ones nobody uses


72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
whether you love it or hate it jabba can


73
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
get stuff done and for that it deserves


74
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,680
our respect thanks for watching and i


75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
will see you in the next one
