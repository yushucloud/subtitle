1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
machine learning teach a computer how to


2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,480
perform a task without explicitly


3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,560
programming it to perform said task


4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,200
instead feed data into an algorithm to


5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,719
gradually improve outcomes with


6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,120
experience similar to how organic life


7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,679
learns the term was coined in 1959 by


8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,080
arthur samuel at ibm who was developing


9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
artificial intelligence that could play


10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
checkers half a century later and


11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
predictive models are embedded in many


12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,279
of the products we use every day which


13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,439
perform two fundamental jobs one is to


14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,519
classify data like is there another car


15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,359
on the road or does this patient have


16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,760
cancer the other is to make predictions


17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,520
about future outcomes like will the


18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
stock go up or which youtube video do


19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,280
you want to watch next the first step in


20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,600
the process is to acquire and clean up


21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
data lots and lots of data the better


22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
the data represents the problem the


23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
better the results garbage in garbage


24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,280
out the data needs to have some kind of


25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,199
signal to be valuable to the algorithm


26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,879
for making predictions and data


27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
scientists perform a job called feature


28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,199
engineering to transform raw data into


29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
features that better represent the


30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
underlying problem the next step is to


31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,199
separate the data into a training set


32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,519
and testing set the training data is fed


33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
into an algorithm to build a model then


34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
the testing data is used to validate the


35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159
accuracy or error of the model the next


36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
step is to choose an algorithm which


37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
might be a simple statistical model like


38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,159
linear or logistic regression or a


39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,840
decision tree that assigns different


40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
weights to features in the data or you


41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
might get fancy with a convolutional


42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,600
neural network which is an algorithm


43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
that also assigns weights to features


44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
but also takes the input data and


45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
creates additional features


46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
automatically and that's extremely


47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
useful for data sets that contain things


48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,560
like images or natural language where


49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
manual feature engineering is virtually


50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
impossible every one of these algorithms


51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,240
learns to get better by comparing its


52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
predictions to an error function if it's


53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,399
a classification problem like is this


54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
animal a cat or a dog the error function


55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,960
might be accuracy if it's a regression


56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,720
problem like how much will a loaf of


57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
bread cost next year then it might be


58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
mean absolute error python is the


59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
language of choice among data scientists


60
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
but r and julia are also popular options


61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
and there are many supporting frameworks


62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
out there to make the process


63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,320
approachable the end result of the


64
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
machine learning process is a model


65
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
which is just a file that takes some


66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
input data in the same shape that it was


67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
trained on then spits out a prediction


68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
that tries to minimize the error that it


69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
was optimized for it can then be


70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,599
embedded on an actual device or deployed


71
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,520
to the cloud to build a real world


72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
