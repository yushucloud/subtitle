1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,860
sign-in with Apple was a feature


2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,080
announced by Apple and 2019 and it


3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,060
allows users to authenticate into a web


4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,040
or mobile application using their Apple


5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,050
ID it works just like other one-click


6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,759
social sign-in methods like Google


7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,340
Facebook Twitter etc to implement this


8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,020
method in your firebase app you'll first


9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,400
need to have an Apple Developer account


10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
which will run you about $99 per year


11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,869
now head over to your Apple developer


12
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,210
portal create a new app ID or update an


13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,250
existing one to use the sign-in with


14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,109
Apple capability from there you'll


15
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,090
create a new service ID and configure it


16
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,099
to work with your domain enter the


17
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,110
hosting URLs from your firebase project


18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,809
then register the service ID now we need


19
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,670
to verify ownership of this domain with


20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,890
Apple go back to the configuration for


21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,690
the service ID you'll see the option to


22
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,120
download a file save that file under the


23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,829
well-known directory in your public


24
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,020
hosting folder then upload this file to


25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,670
firebase hosting by running firebase


26
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,620
deploy from the command line click


27
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,300
verify and you should get a green check


28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,219
mark now the last thing we need is a


29
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,199
private key click on keys and then


30
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,359
generate a new one for Apple sign-in go


31
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,530
ahead and download this file somewhere


32
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,629
securely on your system then open it in


33
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,369
your editor at this point we can go to


34
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,170
the authentication tab on the firebase


35
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,240
console and click enable for Apple


36
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,460
sign-in enter your team ID as well as


37
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,229
the information from the private key and


38
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,150
now we just need to add a little bit of


39
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,950
JavaScript to our front-end app with


40
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,210
firebase initialized we'll make a


41
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,100
reference to auth then we'll define an


42
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,229
async function called sign in with Apple


43
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,270
it instantiates an auth provider for


44
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,820
apple calm then awaits the auth sign in


45
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,590
with pop-up method this prompts the user


46
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,900
to login with their Apple ID and when


47
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,280
they're done they'll be logged into the


48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,049
firebase app and will have access to


49
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,060
their user data on the result this has


50
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,130
been Apple sign-in with firebase in 100


51
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,869
seconds and I realize that was super


52
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,150
fast so head over to fire ship IO to get


53
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,890
a full step-by-step breakdown of the


54
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,780
process thanks for watching make sure to


55
