1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
scalable vector graphics or svg is an


2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,359
image format that's like html for


3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
2d graphics they differ from raster


4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,760
images like png or jpeg


5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
that use a grid of tiny pixels to create


6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
an image and as you zoom in the pixels


7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,839
become larger making the image grainy in


8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,160
contrast a vector image can be scaled to


9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,400
any size without losing its resolution


10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
because instead of fixed pixels its


11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
appearance is based on geometry


12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,760
you can create svgs with tools like


13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,119
figma or illustrator


14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
or by writing the code directly which is


15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,160
easier than you might think


16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
and opens the door to animation and


17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
interactivity create one by opening an


18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,280
svg tag


19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
then define a coordinate system with the


20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,480
view box attribute


21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
that gives us a frame with a width and


22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,800
height of 100 units on which we can draw


23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
graphics draw basic


24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,160
shapes by adding elements like rectangle


25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,920
circle and polygon position the


26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
rectangle by defining its x-y value


27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
on the view box then give it a size


28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
which can take values that are either


29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
explicit or responsive


30
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,280
we can change the color of the shape by


31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
defining its fill or define an outline


32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,120
with the stroke attribute and if our


33
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,120
styling gets too complex we can extract


34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,960
everything into a separate css


35
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,600
stylesheet


36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,760
by applying a class to it just like any


37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
html element


38
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
we have the full power of css at our


39
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
fingertips which means we can react to


40
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,400
events on the shapes and then change


41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
their styling or animation accordingly


42
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
but most graphics are more than just


43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
basic shapes they contain complex


44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
artwork with all kinds of twists and


45
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
turns and that's where the path element


46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,400
comes in


47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
the shape of a path is determined by one


48
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,439
attribute d


49
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
for draw coding a path is like


50
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,960
controlling the tip of a pen with a


51
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,000
series of commands


52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,400
the most basic command is m for move


53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
which will move the pen tip to an x y


54
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,880
coordinate


55
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,799
an uppercase letter means move relative


56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,880
to the view box and lowercase means


57
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
move relative to the last point in the


58
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
path but move doesn't actually draw


59
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,200
anything


60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
to put the pen tip down on the paper and


61
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
draw something use the l command


62
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
it works exactly like move but draws a


63
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
line that can be styled


64
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,159
straight lines are cool but what if we


65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,159
wanted to add a curve like we would with


66
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,680
the handles in illustrator


67
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
create bezier curves with the c and q


68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
commands define the position of two


69
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,799
control points


70
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,240
then the x and y coordinates where the


71
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
curve should end then svg will


72
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
automatically calculate a smooth curve


73
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,640
for you


74
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
at any scale this has been scalable


75
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,800
