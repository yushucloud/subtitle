00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,480
unity a cross-platform game engine for


2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,640
building 2d and 3d experiences made


3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,560
famous for democratizing the immense


4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
challenge of game development it was


5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,400
created in copenhagen denmark and first


6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,880
released in 2005. today it's the magic


7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
behind many popular games like the 2d


8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
among us


9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,920
the 3d monument valley augmented reality


10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
apps like pokemon go first-person


11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
shooters like escape from tarkov as well


12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,519
as interactive simulations and


13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,519
animations beyond the gaming industry


14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,439
the engine itself is written in c plus


15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
plus but allows developers to write


16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
their code in the more approachable c


17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
sharp in addition it provides a powerful


18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,719
graphical editor allowing you to draw


19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
shapes work with cameras and apply


20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
materials without having to write a


21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
single line of code every game object


22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
can have a variety of components like a


23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,079
mesh to define its actual physical shape


24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
a mesh renderer to apply materials and


25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
lighting to an object and physics


26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,239
components like rigidbody and colliders


27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,160
that simulate things like gravity and


28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,239
collisions in the real world and finally


29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,239
you can extend an object with your own c


30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,760
sharp code to make it do something


31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,520
interesting like take hit points when it


32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
runs into a bad guy to build your first


33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
video game right now install unity hub


34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,680
create a new project then open up the


35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
editor you'll be greeted with a 3d scene


36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
that contains a light source and a


37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
camera a scene is like a game level that


38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
you're developing while the camera is


39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,479
the point of view of the player to


40
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
create a game of dodgeball let's add a


41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
plane to be the ground a cylinder for


42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
the player and a sphere for the ball


43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
select an object then hit y on your


44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
keyboard to move rotate and scale it to


45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,920
your liking hit the play button and


46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,200
notice how these shapes don't do


47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
anything but if we add a rigid body to


48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,799
the objects all of a sudden they're now


49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,479
impacted by the laws of gravity


50
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
currently they look pretty boring but we


51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
can make them look cool by creating a


52
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
material and then drag it onto the


53
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
shapes and now to make this game


54
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,799
playable let's add a script component to


55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,399
it and then open it in vs code it


56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
contains a class with two methods to


57
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,399
implement your code start is called once


58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,000
at the very beginning of the game while


59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,759
update is called on every frame while


60
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,280
the game is being played and there's


61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
also fixed update that runs at the same


62
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
frame rate as the physics engine now to


63
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,880
move our player around we can define a


64
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,799
public property for the rigid body which


65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
contains a bunch of different properties


66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
and methods to move the object around


67
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,159
now assign an actual value from the game


68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,920
to that property by dragging the rigid


69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,759
body component to it in the editor in


70
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,599
the fixed update method we can first use


71
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
input to detect when a user presses the


72
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
arrow keys and then call the move


73
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
position method on the rigid body to


74
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
move it hit the play button and you


75
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,319
should now be able to move your player


76
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
around from there we can add a script to


77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
the ball that will add force to it when


78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
the game starts to roll it across the


79
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
screen and we can also run code when the


80
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,760
two objects collide by defining the on


81
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
collision enter method congratulations


82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,599
you just built a video game this has


83
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
been unity in 100 seconds if you want to
