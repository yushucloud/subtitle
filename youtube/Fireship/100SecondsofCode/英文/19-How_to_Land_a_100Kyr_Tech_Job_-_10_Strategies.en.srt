9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,800

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
hours per day googling how to get his


11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,160

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,480
i want to point out that i've been


19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
working independently for about a decade


20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
so to make this video i reached out to a


21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,000
few different hiring managers both at


22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
big mega corporations and startups to


23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,680
figure out what the decision makers are


24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,120
actually looking for especially when


25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,039
hiring a self-taught programmer with no


26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
prior experience as of today the job


27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
market is likely stronger than it's ever


28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
been before there's all kinds of stories


29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,160
of people quitting their jobs in the


30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
great resignation only to land a much


31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
higher paying job because there's a


32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
massive shortage of talent that spans


33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
across many industries it's really weird


34
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
and i've never seen anything like this


35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
before it's great if you're looking for


36
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
a new job but there may be some warning


37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
signs on the horizon many of the top


38
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
publicly traded tech companies have seen


39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
their stock prices quietly crash over


40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,479
the last few months companies like


41
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
twilio and cloudflare are down 50 from


42
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
their highs of last year a lot of big


43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,240
money is moving out of profitless tech


44
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,840
companies and generally that's not a


45
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,080
good sign for tech jobs but that's just


46
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
a short-term concern over the long term


47
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
i think tech is one of the safest and


48
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
best places you could possibly work the


49
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,479
first thing you'll need is the right


50
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,240
attitude getting a high paying job in


51
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,000
tech is hard there's a lot of overly


52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,920
optimistic marketing bs out there that


53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
might make you think you just go to a


54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
boot camp for a few weeks and


55
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
immediately after you're making a


56
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
hundred thousand dollars there are some


57
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,200
success stories that go like that but


58
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,720
for the most part it's a very difficult


59
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
grind that requires you to be highly


60
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
motivated and highly persistent to put


61
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
things in perspective lambda school who


62
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
recently changed its name to the bloom


63
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
institute of technology i wonder why


64
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,360
they did that charges 22 000 in tuition


65
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
but guarantees a job earning 50 000


66
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
after you graduate that's about what a


67
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
taco bell manager makes what they teach


68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
you is the same stuff you can learn here


69
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
on youtube but they support you by


70
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
making you hirable the same thing i'm


71
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
trying to teach you on youtube for free


72
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,200
right now now if you don't get a job


73
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
after the program they will refund 110


74
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
of the tuition however in order to


75
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,360
qualify for that you'll need to spend a


76
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
year applying to 10 jobs per week


77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
reaching out to 10 professionals for


78
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
networking and making at least five


79
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
github contributions that means you'll


80
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,879
need to apply to at least 520 jobs and


81
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,959
be rejected from every single one they


82
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,239
know it's a grind and you should have


83
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,760
the same mindset when going into it


84
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
yourself independently but on the bright


85
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
side it's definitely achievable if you


86
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
work hard at it and accept the fact that


87
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,160
you're probably going to have to face a


88
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
lot of rejection before you finally do


89
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
land a job i'd recommend subscribing to


90
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,360
the dorian develops youtube channel who


91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
has a recent video about his story about


92
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
landing a job as a self-taught


93
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
programmer it took him about a year now


94
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
let's move on to strategy 2. live in the


95
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
united states specifically in new york


96
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,959
city the bay area or seattle in the 2021


97
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,959
stack overflow survey the median salary


98
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,440
for engineers is well below 100k in the


99
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
united states though it jumps up to


100
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
about 130k a few weeks ago i posted a


101
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
poll on this channel that has a 150 000


102
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
responses yet only 11 percent are making


103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,159
more than 100k sadly where you live


104
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,680
really does make a big difference so


105
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,200
keep your expectations in line with your


106
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
region now the key to getting hired is


107
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
to make yourself valuable think of it


108
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
from the eyes of the employer why would


109
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,840
they actually want to hire you what


110
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
value would you add to the team to the


111
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
product to the company etc most tech


112
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,040
companies don't actually make any money


113
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
but the general idea of employment is


114
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
that the employer can make a profit off


115
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,000
of your labor the question becomes how


116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
do we make you desirable to these


117
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,360
potential employers there are many


118
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
things you can start doing today in


119
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,799
strategy three we'll look at twitter


120
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,159
there's a whole subculture out there


121
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,680
called tech twitter and i've seen tons


122
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,519
of people land a job simply by adding


123
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
value to this tech twitter community


124
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
there's a pretty simple formula for


125
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
growing a twitter account to get started


126
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,319
follow the influential people that you


127
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,760
want to be hired by then create a


128
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
profile that's totally transparent that


129
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
you're on a journey to land your first


130
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
job in tech then you can start


131
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
responding to other people's tweets with


132
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
encouragement and positivity people will


133
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
think hey bob's a really nice guy i want


134
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,040
to see him succeed and i'm going to


135
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
follow him to watch it happen from there


136
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
you need to hack the out of the


137
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,439
twitter algorithm whenever you learn


138
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
something new post a thread about it if


139
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
you have any good code tips use carbon


140
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
to create a snippet and post it with a


141
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
bunch of emojis you'll also want to


142
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
create lists with resources for


143
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,959
developers like the best youtube


144
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,400
channels to learn programming and make


145
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
sure you put fireship as number one it


146
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
also helps to tweet out open-ended


147
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
questions and to come up with your own


148
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,120
memes the majority of my twitter growth


149
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
has been the result of memes if you're


150
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,080
serious you should be tweeting every


151
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
single day like multiple times per day


152
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
one account i followed tweets an average


153
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,840
of 37 times per day which generates an


154
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
average of 277 new followers per day you


155
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,080
don't need to be that prolific but just


156
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
try to be consistent more importantly


157
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
though don't screw things up by saying


158
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,199
something


159
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
like if you tweet out man my code is


160
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,720
being right now somebody with a


161
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
lot of followers who thinks they're a


162
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
lot more important than they really are


163
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
might call you out and then everybody


164
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
will dog pile on you and at that point


165
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
your journey into tech will be over


166
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
before it started now that you know how


167
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
twitter works let's move into strategy


168
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
four linkedin there are tons of


169
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
recruiters on linkedin who can help you


170
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
get a job in tech but remember bob


171
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
doesn't have any connections in tech yet


172
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
so how does he even get started with


173
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
linkedin well the first thing you can do


174
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
is find people you look up to and send


175
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,039
them a message that you're looking to


176
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,400
get into tech and that you would like to


177
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
connect most humans are actually pretty


178
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,360
nice and will connect with you no


179
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,039
problem feel free to make me your first


180
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
connection if you'd like also join


181
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
groups for the different technologies


182
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,199
that you're interested in and


183
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
participate in them if possible you can


184
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
also build your network by posting


185
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,240
content you can actually just reuse the


186
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,919
content you've been using for threads on


187
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,000
twitter and post it to linkedin now that


188
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
you have your linkedin network going we


189
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,199
can talk about the most important social


190
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
site in github as a self-taught


191
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
programmer it's very important that you


192
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
at least have something going on in your


193
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,919
github in a perfect world you have


194
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,759
commits every single day not only to


195
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
your own project but to many other open


196
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,360
source projects out there that's not


197
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,039
very realistic but it's important to be


198
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,880
consistent and that's exactly why lambda


199
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
school or bloom institute of technology


200
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,479
requires that you make five github


201
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
contributions per week to an employer it


202
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,000
shows that you're capable of writing


203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
code every day which tends to be a


204
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,039
pretty important part of the job if


205
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,400
you're just getting started one of the


206
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,319
easiest ways to contribute is to look


207
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
for typos in the documentation fireship


208
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
io for example is open source and you


209
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
can find all kinds of typos in it if you


210
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
fix it and send a pull request you can


211
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,080
easily add that contribution to your


212
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,759
timeline as you start using more open


213
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,759
source libraries don't be afraid to open


214
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
issues when you find problems and if you


215
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
want to contribute look for issues that


216
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
are tagged with good first issue it is


217
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
true that you're kind of working for


218
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,479
free here but doing so will make your


219
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
github profile much stronger and it's


220
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
just great experience as a developer in


221
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
fact if you don't have fun doing this


222
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
kind of stuff then maybe a career as a


223
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
software engineer isn't the best career


224
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,880
path now that your github is impressive


225
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
it's time to build a personal project


226
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,800
because bob is a developer that nobody


227
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,479
knows he needs to show employers that he


228
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,759
can actually build something that's


229
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,600
non-trivial ideally something that will


230
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
blow people's minds that cannot be


231
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
ignored you are much better off having


232
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,440
one really awesome app than 10 mediocre


233
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
apps quality is much better than


234
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
quantity when it comes to your portfolio


235
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
the engineering manager who hires you is


236
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
likely a much better programmer than you


237
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,759
are they'll be able to tell if your


238
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,360
portfolio is filled with a bunch of


239
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,199
cookie cutter projects recreated from


240
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
tutorials on youtube give yourself three


241
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
to six months to build something that is


242
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
truly impressive one example is the


243
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,199
portfolio of bruno simon he used 3js to


244
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
build an interactive 3d landscape to


245
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,880
showcase his work the reaction from


246
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
other developers should be something


247
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
like wow that would not be an easy app


248
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
to pull off it's so good that i want to


249
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
include it in my youtube video building


250
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,039
an app is one thing but the next


251
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,360
strategy is to build this app in public


252
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
what i mean by that is you should


253
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
transparently document the entire


254
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
process while you spend the next few


255
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
months building something awesome the


256
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,280
most common way to do that is by


257
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
blogging there are many sites out there


258
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
like dev2 and medium to create your own


259
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,599
blog easily but i would highly recommend


260
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,759
blogging on your own custom built site


261
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
in my opinion a custom site expresses


262
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,759
more passion about the craft of web


263
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,520
development in addition to blogging


264
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,039
you'll also want to be documenting the


265
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,879
process on linkedin and twitter and you


266
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319
may even consider starting your own


267
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,000
youtube channel building in public is


268
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
extremely powerful because it creates a


269
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,360
feedback loop you don't otherwise get


270
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,639
when you're just working alone in your


271
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,319
mom's basement there's a whole community


272
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,080
of startups who are building in public


273
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
you should give them feedback on their


274
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,879
products and in return they'll do the


275
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,120
same to make your project better in fact


276
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
you might even consider monetizing your


277
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
project because if you build something


278
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,360
really good you might end up


279
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
accidentally creating a job for yourself


280
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
one example of a success story is


281
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
superhuman an email application that


282
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
charges thirty dollars per month that


283
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
was built in public they got tons of


284
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
great feedback from potential customers


285
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,440
while building the product and you can


286
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
do the same thing with your personal


287
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,800
brand while looking for a job now we can


288
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,479
move into strategy eight real life


289
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,080
networking where you actually have to


290
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
like look at people's faces and say


291
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
words to them and stuff as an introvert


292
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
this has never come easy for me but what


293
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
i can tell you is that some of the best


294
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,880
business contacts i have come from real


295
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,200
life interactions believe it or not zoom


296
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
or the metaverse doesn't replace the


297
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,039
magic of face-to-face human interaction


298
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
i'm here live that's not i'm not a cat


299
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
the pandemic has ruined this in a lot of


300
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,839
ways but traditionally the best way to


301
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
meet people locally is through meetups


302
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
all you have to do is find your local


303
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
programming meetup show up there and eat


304
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
some free pizza and maybe you'll meet


305
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,680
someone important that can help you down


306
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
the road now the other thing i'd


307
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
recommend is attending conferences it's


308
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
more expensive but a lot of hiring


309
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
managers and employees attend these


310
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
things and they're often looking for


311
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,600
people to hire who are interested in


312
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,120
their tech stack learning the basic


313
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
skill of introducing yourself and making


314
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
small talk can go a really long way when


315
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
it comes to landing a job you just have


316
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
to get in a room with the right people


317
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
they say it's not what you know but who


318
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,360
you know speaking of which another


319
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,519
powerful strategy is to get a mentor


320
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
which is much easier to do when you make


321
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,959
a real-life connection it might be a


322
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,880
person with 20 years of experience or a


323
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,399
person that's just one step ahead of you


324
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
who just landed their first job it's


325
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
extremely valuable to have a person in


326
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
the industry who you can have an honest


327
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,040
conversation with you're likely making


328
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,399
many mistakes that you don't even


329
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
realize having a mentor who can validate


330
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
or criticize the things you're doing is


331
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
much faster than actually making those


332
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,440
mistakes and learning from them one by


333
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,959
one most boot camps will give you a


334
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
mentor and that's one of the main things


335
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
you pay them for but you'd be surprised


336
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,760
at how many people out there will mentor


337
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,279
you for free because at one point they


338
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,800
were in your shoes and people are more


339
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,480
altruistic than you might think and that


340
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
brings me to strategy number 10 be a


341
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
good fit as you start applying for jobs


342
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,920
you'll mostly hear crickets but if


343
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,120
you're lucky you'll get a phone


344
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
interview and then be rejected the next


345
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
day the natural reaction here is to be


346
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
sad and to feel worthless or you might


347
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,079
be angry at the company or think the


348
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,839
interviewer treated you unfairly but the


349
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
reality is that rejection is just the


350
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,600
story you tell yourself the best way to


351
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,360
respond to it is accept it as part of


352
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
life and selfishly see what you can gain


353
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
from it maybe ask for feedback or


354
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,880
guidance to help you do better next time


355
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
what you'll notice about successful


356
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
people is that they're persistent they


357
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
fail over and over again without caring


358
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
until finally something works now the


359
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,959
other thing to keep in mind is that a


360
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,640
company won't hire you based on your


361
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
technical skill alone i mean it


362
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
definitely helps but they also want to


363
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,279
make sure that you fit into their


364
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
company culture as a candidate they want


365
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,959
you to embrace their core values and


366
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,160
make sure that you'll fit into their


367
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,079
management leadership style before you


368
