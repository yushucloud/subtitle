view j/s it's a JavaScript framework for building front-end UIs in view you can

start simple and then progressively add in the tools and features that you need

to build a complex web application at its core it provides a way to build

components that encapsulate data or state in your JavaScript and then

connect that state reactively to a template in HTML we call these

components declarative views because the same data inputs will always produce the

same output in the visual UI when we declare data on this data object it

links or binds it to the HTML on the template above when the value of the

data changes the component will automatically rerender or in other words

it's reactive and the framework does a ton of work under the hood to make sure

that this process is performance across a huge component tree we can work with

this data in the template thanks to views HTML based template syntax we can

interpolate a value for expression using double braces and we also have a variety

of directives to control the behavior of the HTML based on the data we can use VF

to only render an element when the value on the right side is truthy and then we

might have a fallback element after that that's only rendered when the values

fall C with v-else we can make the app interactive by listening to events using

the V on directive we can listen to an event on an element then run some code

to handle that event on the right side we can do that directly in the template

or define a custom method and the components methods object the method has

access to our reactive data and that means all we have to do is change the

value of the data and the component will automatically rerender and that's all it

takes to build an interactive reactive declarative UI component with view the

framework is loved by developers for the simplicity but also its ability to scale

up in complexity incrementally its plugin system allows you to easily drop

in things like a router state management firebase support and more and perhaps

best of all it's not sponsored by some mega corporation it's not pressured to

push out new releases all the time and does a great job listening to its

community this has been GU Jas and 100 seconds stay tuned for a full length

tutorial here on YouTube in the near future and check out my view firebase

course on fire ship if you're ready to start building a full stack app thanks

for watching and I will see you in the next one
