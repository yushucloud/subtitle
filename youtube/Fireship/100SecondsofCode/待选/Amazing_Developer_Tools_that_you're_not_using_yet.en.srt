[Music]


2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,820
one of the most important lessons I've


3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,260
learned as a developer is to work


4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,030
smarter and not harder and one of the


5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,590
best ways to live by that rule is to use


6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,150
tools that make you more productive and


7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,800
simplify your life today we'll look at


8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,029
seven different tools that I use


9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,529
personally that you may or may not have


10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,180
heard of in fact if you're already using


11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,529
all seven of these tools go ahead and


12
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:24,240
download the video but otherwise make


13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,859
sure to LIKE and subscribe and leave a


14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,150
comment below because I'll be picking


15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,039
one random comment next week to win this


16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,689
t-shirt first a little bit about myself


17
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,130
I'm a front-end web developer slash


18
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,290
back-end engineer / ux designer /


19
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,570
entrepreneur / accidental youtuber and


20
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,129
video creator so the list you're about


21
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,300
to see is very much geared towards


22
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,860
developers who are involved at virtually


23
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,300
every point in the product creation


24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,579
process and full disclosure nobody pays


25
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,170
me a dime to say nice things about these


26
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,579
products they're tools that I use in my


27
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,930
day-to-day work that I generally enjoy


28
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,969
and think will be useful to you let's


29
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,860
get started in no particular order with


30
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,840
bundle phobia this is a web application


31
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,850
that allows you to determine how much an


32
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,649
NPM package will add to your total


33
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,270
bundle size if you're working with a


34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,680
modern front-end framework you want to


35
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,300
try and keep the bundle size as small as


36
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,159
possible to optimize the initial page


37
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,080
load for new users bundle phobia makes


38
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,939
it very easy to analyze the addition of


39
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,650
a new dependency to your project just


40
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,270
enter the package name and it will tell


41
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,070
you the bundle size the download time


42
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,659
whether or not it's tree shaker Bowl as


43
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,310
well as a bunch of other information for


44
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,200
every single version of that package and


45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,909
you can even upload your entire package


46
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,710
JSON to see all of your dependencies


47
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,869
ranked by size if you suffer from bundle


48
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,640
phobia like I do this is definitely an


49
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,470
app you have to check out now let's


50
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,670
check out another web app that will help


51
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,049
you design and budget your cloud


52
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,240
infrastructure called cloud craft it's


53
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,159
currently only available for AWS but


54
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,140
even though I mostly use GCP I still


55
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,610
find it useful it provides a very


56
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,409
intuitive drag-and-drop interface that


57
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,000
allows you to connect different cloud


58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,189
infrastructure services together not


59
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,659
only is this great for planning but it's


60
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,159
also great for budgeting once you have


61
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,360
your infrastructure in place you can go


62
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,740
to the budget tab and it will give you


63
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,420
an estimated breakdown of your total


64
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,009
cost and because all the major clouds


65
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,720
have similar pricing models the actual


66
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
results will translate pretty well to


67
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,670
Azure and GCP next up is figma which is


68
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,170
probably the most well known app on this


69
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,850
list but I'm a longtime Adobe


70
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,560
Illustrator user so for me to switch to


71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
figma means it has to offer at least 10


72
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,340
times more value than illustrator and it


73
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,660
actually delivers on that in a variety


74
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,640
of ways first of all figma is a design


75
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
tool that allows you to draw graphics


76
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,450
create mock-ups for your apps and while


77
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,010
it provides a desktop app it also


78
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,660
provides a web app that's just as good


79
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,430
and perform it as the desktop version


80
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,200
and it achieves such amazing performance


81
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,340
by using webassembly


82
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,959
it seems kind of crazy but I'm Way more


83
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,910
productive in the figma web app than I


84
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,709
am in the adobe illustrator desktop app


85
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,360
and it's completely free for my graphic


86
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,830
design needs and because it's web-based


87
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,599
I can open up my project on any machine


88
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,099
and all my files will be there


89
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,200
immediately without any effort but aside


90
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,580
from that it's also just a really


91
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,290
well-designed piece of software it's


92
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,849
similar to sketch in the sense that it


93
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,080
gives you all the things that you need


94
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,519
and want and none of the crap that you


95
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,290
don't and it has some superpowers if


96
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,880
you're an app developer for example you


97
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,590
can lock up different events that happen


98
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,269
on the elements and then you can even


99
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,150
export your styles as CSS or as Android


100
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,340
or iOS styles I've been consistently


101
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,870
impressed with figma across the board


102
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,160
and I really feel like I should be


103
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,360
paying them more than zero dollars a


104
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,190
month to be using this thing but there


105
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,810
are times when a full-blown design tool


106
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,730
is more than you actually need so that


107
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,530
brings me to another web app called font


108
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,750
clipper this app is built using angular


109
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,610
and firebase and its sole purpose is to


110
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,650
help you choose fonts for your designs


111
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,330
there are hundreds if not thousands of


112
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,860
free fonts on Google but it's really


113
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,420
tedious to go through and try to figure


114
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,220
out the perfect one for your design


115
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,720
font flipper allows you to bring in your


116
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,489
own graphics and then experiment with


117
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,109
different fonts and what I really like


118
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:26,190
about it is that it's just a really


119
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,260
focused and simple UI that doesn't


120
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,090
distract you in any way but the coolest


121
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,470
feature is how you actually select the


122
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,150
fonts and it's done with a tinder style


123
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,950
UI where you swipe left for things you


124
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,450
don't like and right for things you do


125
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,069
like and once you decide on a few fonts


126
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,390
that you like you can just go download


127
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,220
them directly from google fonts now


128
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,299
we're going to switch gears and look at


129
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,040
a new Chrome extension called viz bug


130
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,079
this was released earlier this year and


131
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,639
it's a tool that allows you to interact


132
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,739
visually with your website you can see


133
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,600
here we're on fire ship IO and then we


134
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,010
have this toolbar over on the left side


135
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,019
and these pink lions hovering all over


136
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,519
the different dom elements on the site


137
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,930
there's all kinds of different stuff we


138
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,400
can do here and I may do a full tutorial


139
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,410
in the future but basically we can


140
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,880
measure elements we can move things


141
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,100
around change their style and you can do


142
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,450
everything live in the browser without


143
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,340
having to write a single line of CSS


144
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,109
this is extremely powerful because you


145
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,250
can get things to a state that you


146
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,660
actually like and then instead of


147
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,459
rewriting all that CSS you can just copy


148
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,019
and paste it from the inspector and


149
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,729
another thing I really like is that you


150
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,139
can search for a specific type of


151
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,030
element for example if you want to find


152
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,560
all the links on the page we can just


153
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,580
search for them and they'll all be


154
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,740
highlighted in pink the plugin does have


155
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,700
a little bit of a learning


156
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,290
to get used to but once you have that


157
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,360
down it will save you a ton of time now


158
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,830
let's switch gears to a back-end tool


159
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,870
that you can use to debug API is called


160
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,730
insomnia I've worked with a lot of rest


161
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,260
clients over the years and you can use


162
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,000
ones that are integrated directly in vs


163
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,530
code but I always seem to go back to


164
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,240
insomnia whether you're building a REST


165
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,730
API or a graph QL API this app will help


166
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,620
you keep your entire workflow organized


167
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,780
it allows you to save reusable values


168
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,340
that you can go back and use as you


169
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,900
debug your API because you definitely


170
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,920
don't wanna be spending your time


171
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,140
rewriting tedious HTTP requests every


172
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,760
day and on top of that it just has a


173
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,800
beautiful and well laid out UI for


174
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,090
example we might want to create a new


175
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,670
request for the SpaceX graph QL API and


176
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,680
insomnia will automatically do the


177
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,360
introspection so all we have to do is


178
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,830
start typing out our query and we'll get


179
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,690
this awesome intellisense for everything


180
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,430
we type so the power of graph QL


181
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,290
combined with insomnia just gives you an


182
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,210
awesome overall developer experience and


183
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,430
with that we'll move on to the seventh


184
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,710
and final app flare this is another


185
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,360
design tool but one specifically for


186
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,730
creating 2d vector animations it's


187
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,200
similar to figma in the sense that you


188
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,790
can use it to draw graphics but you'll


189
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,350
see down here at the bottom we also have


190
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,420
keyframes to control the motion of the


191
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,520
graphics over time and flare is part of


192
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,140
the open design movement which means you


193
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,520
can see the work of all kinds of other


194
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,560
designers directly on the site and learn


195
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
exactly how they built their animations


196
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,740
but a big part of the reason I'm really


197
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,270
excited about flare is that these


198
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,130
graphics can be exported to work in


199
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,840
flutter that means that implementing in


200
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,640
beautiful high-performance animations in


201
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,380
a native mobile app is easier than ever


202
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,180
before I'll create a full tutorial on


203
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,290
this in the future but if you're


204
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,000
building animations in a native app I


205
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,710
can't imagine a better option than flare


206
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,150
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap the list up


207
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,440
there like I said at the beginning of


208
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,790
the video these are all products that I


209
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,440
use personally and that I can vouch for


210
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
and another thing I just realized that


211
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,620
wasn't planned is that all these tools


212
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,270
are free and they're also all built with


213
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,010
web technologies and that's a beautiful


214
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,570
thing in my opinion I'd really like to


215
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,710
hear more about the tools that make you


216
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,120
more productive so let me know what


217
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,710
you're using in the comments if this


218
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,880
video helped you please like and
