1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,760
networking it's the way computers exchange information around the world

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,120
and just like the burrito its architecture is abstracted into seven

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
layers based on the open systems interconnection model

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
at the bottom we have physical hardware like fiber optic cables that literally

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,039
carry light from point a to point b somehow this light travels all the way

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,439
to layer seven where it can be transmitted directly into your

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
consciousness in the form of pixels on a screen or vibrations from a speaker

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
that's exactly what you're doing right now as an end user accessing this video

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,480
over the hypertext transfer protocol in addition to http there are many other

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
protocols at layer 7 like smpt for email or ftp for file

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,960
transfers now let's work our way backwards to

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,239
understand how we got here layer 6 is the presentation layer and

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,680
essentially it works as a translator to ensure that a stream of bits from a

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,239
computer like a jpeg image is encoded to a

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,039
standard format that can be used at the application layer

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
below that we have the session layer which is responsible for managing the

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
connection between two computers it's here we have things like user

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
authentication and authorization to control whether or not a user has

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,160
access to data on a server we've all been on a zoom call where some

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,600
random person joins and shares their unsolicited artwork they manage to

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
authenticate on zoom servers by exploiting layer 5

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,680
and that brings us to the middle of the stack the transport layer

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,520
the transmission control protocol or tcp is the foundation for

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,799
pretty much everything we've looked at so far its job is to take a stream of

25
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,920
data from one computer and transfer it to another it determines

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,680
how to segment the data into smaller pieces that can be sent over the network

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
in the correct order it receives the data from layer 4 the

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,960
network layer in the form of packets it's here we find the internet protocol

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,400
every computer connected to the network has its own unique ip address

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
which identifies that computer and whenever it sends information over the

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,399
network it does so in the form of an ip packet

32
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,640
that contains that address in the header a packet is just a unit of data along

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,079
with some information about who sent it this happens from a router or gateway

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,759
which connects to layer two the data link and its role is to connect

35
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,520
one physical node in the network to another via protocols like ethernet or

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
wi-fi and that is how over 2.5 quintillion

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
bytes of data are shared around the world every single day

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
