00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,600
hypertext markup language or html is a language that defines the structure of

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,200
content on a webpage development started in 1989 at cern by tim berners-lee who

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,400
had just invented the world's first web browser world wide web the origin of www

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
but he needed a publishing language to display content within it so he chose a

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,720
syntax based on the standard generalized markup language which uses opening and

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,119
closing tags to provide meaning to otherwise unorganized text like h4

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,760
heading p for paragraph and most importantly a for anchor to link to a

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,640
different web page the language underwent many changes during the

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,120
initial rise of the internet and was standardized as html5 in 2008 the

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,680
version we know and love today modern html contains tags to handle a variety

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,399
of different media types like video audio and canvas to draw custom graphics

12
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,960
on the fly the typical html element starts with an opening and closing tag

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,879
in the middle we have content which might be text or additional html

14
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,199
elements called children the opening tag may also have one or more attributes

15
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,880
which are key value pairs that can customize the appearance or behavior of

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,000
the element to build your first web page create a file named index.html this file

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
contains a hierarchy of nodes based on the document object model or dom a

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,000
webpage starts with an html tag and has exactly two children a head and a body

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,840
the head contains things that aren't directly shown in the webpage like a

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
title or a meta tag to give the page a description but notice how the meta

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
element has no closing tag closing tags are generally optional when an element

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
is fully self-contained the body contains the actual ui for the end user

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
we might start with an h1 heading followed by a paragraph of content to

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,720
add an image we use an image tag which you'll notice is self-closing then

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
define the source attribute as the file path to the image and you'll want to

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,000
give it an old description to make it accessible to robots and screen readers

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
what makes web pages revolutionary though is their ability to link to other

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
web pages on the information super highway use an anchor tag to create a

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,439
link then define the href attributes as the webpage that you want to navigate to

30
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,920
when clicked html also provides structural tags like division or div

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
which are often used to group elements together where they can be styled to

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
represent complex ui elements like navbars when you're happy with your code

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,440
grab the full file path to the html file and paste it into any web browser

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,360
