hypertext markup language or html is a language that defines the structure of

content on a webpage development started in 1989 at cern by tim berners-lee who

had just invented the world's first web browser world wide web the origin of www

but he needed a publishing language to display content within it so he chose a

syntax based on the standard generalized markup language which uses opening and

closing tags to provide meaning to otherwise unorganized text like h4

heading p for paragraph and most importantly a for anchor to link to a

different web page the language underwent many changes during the

initial rise of the internet and was standardized as html5 in 2008 the

version we know and love today modern html contains tags to handle a variety

of different media types like video audio and canvas to draw custom graphics

on the fly the typical html element starts with an opening and closing tag

in the middle we have content which might be text or additional html

elements called children the opening tag may also have one or more attributes

which are key value pairs that can customize the appearance or behavior of

the element to build your first web page create a file named index.html this file

contains a hierarchy of nodes based on the document object model or dom a

webpage starts with an html tag and has exactly two children a head and a body

the head contains things that aren't directly shown in the webpage like a

title or a meta tag to give the page a description but notice how the meta

element has no closing tag closing tags are generally optional when an element

is fully self-contained the body contains the actual ui for the end user

we might start with an h1 heading followed by a paragraph of content to

add an image we use an image tag which you'll notice is self-closing then

define the source attribute as the file path to the image and you'll want to

give it an old description to make it accessible to robots and screen readers

what makes web pages revolutionary though is their ability to link to other

web pages on the information super highway use an anchor tag to create a

link then define the href attributes as the webpage that you want to navigate to

when clicked html also provides structural tags like division or div

which are often used to group elements together where they can be styled to

represent complex ui elements like navbars when you're happy with your code

grab the full file path to the html file and paste it into any web browser
