docker a tool that can package software into containers that run reliably in any
docker是一个可以将软件打包到任何环境中的可靠容器运行工具

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,919
environment but what is a container and why do you need one let's imagine you
但是什么是容器以及为什么需要容器，让我们假设您使用cobalt构建了一个应用程序

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,120
built an app with cobalt that runs on some weird flavor of linux you want to

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,080
share this app with your friend but he has an entirely different system so the
分享这个应用程序，你们有两个完全不同的系统

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,520
problem becomes how do we replicate the environment our software needs on any
问题变成了我们如何在任何机器上复制我们的软件所需的环境

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,320
machine one way to package an app is with a virtual machine where the
打包应用程序的一种方法是使用虚拟机模拟硬件环境

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,160
hardware is simulated then installed with the required os and dependencies
然后安装所需的操作系统和相关软件

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,920
this allows us to run multiple apps on the same infrastructure however because
这允许我们在同一个基础设施上运行多个应用程序

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
each vm is running its own operating system they
但是每个虚拟机都运行自己的操作系统

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
tend to be bulky and slow now a docker container is conceptually
因此它们往往体积庞大且运行速度慢

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,960
very similar to a vm with one key difference instead of
与虚拟机非常相似，单有一个关键性区别

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
virtualizing hardware containers only virtualize the os
那就是虚拟化操作系统，而不是虚拟化硬件容器

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
or in other words all apps or containers are run by a single kernel
或者换句话说，所有应用程序或容器都在单个内核运行

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,360
and this makes almost everything faster and more efficient there are three
这使得几乎所有事情都变得更快、更高效

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
fundamental elements in the universe of docker
docker宇宙中包含三个基本元素

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
the docker file the image and the container the docker file is like dna
docker文件、docker镜像、docker容器文件，

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,640
it's just code that tells docker how to build an image which itself is a
他们就像DNA只告诉docker如何构建镜像的代码

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
snapshot of your software along with all of its dependencies down
它是软件快照以及它的所有

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,680
to the operating system level the image is immutable and it can be used to spin
对于操作系统级别的依赖，该映像不可变用于启动多个容器

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,799
up multiple containers which is your actual software running in the real
这是您在现实世界中运行的实际软件

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,360
world create a docker file and use from to
创建一个docker文件并使用

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,119
start from an existing template like ubuntu this base image gets pulled down
从现有模板开始,如ubuntu，此基础映从云中像被拉取下来

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,600
from the cloud and you can also upload your own images
您还可以将自己的镜像上传到

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,759
to a variety of different docker registries
各种不同的docker注册中心中

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
from there you might want to use run to run a terminal command that installs
您可能希望使用run命令将依赖项安装到镜像中

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
dependencies into your image you can set environment variables and do
然后您可以设置环境变量并执行其他各种命令

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,360
all kinds of other stuff then the last thing you'll do is set a default command
你要做的最后一件事是设置一个在

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,439
that's executed when you start up a container
启动容器时执行的默认命令

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,880
and now we can create the image file by running the docker build command
现在我们可以通过运行 docker build 命令来创建镜像文件

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
it goes through each step in our docker file to build the image layer by layer
它通过我们的docker文件中的每个步骤逐层构建映像

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,560
we can then bring this image to life as a container with the docker run command
然后我们可以使用 docker run 命令将该映像作为容器赋予生命

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,240
as your app demands more resources you can run it on multiple machines multiple
当您的应用程序需要更多资源时

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,600
clouds on-prem or wherever you want reliably this has

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
been docker in 100 seconds if you enjoyed it make sure to like and
