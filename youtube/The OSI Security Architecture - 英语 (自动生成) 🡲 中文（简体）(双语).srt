00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
so we will talk about this one by one elaborately in the coming lectures
所以我们将在接下来的讲座中详细讨论这个

88
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,919
but i will give you an introduction of all the topics now

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
from functioning properly it is an attack so firstly we will focus
的正常运行这是一种攻击 所以首先我们将

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,199
on the security attack this attack means it is the action that
关注安全攻击这种攻击意味着它是

94
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,120
compromises the security so whenever any action is carried out
危害安全性的操作，因此无论何时执行任何操作

95

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
attack then what is security mechanism it is to
攻击那么什么是安全机制 检测安全

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,360
detect prevent or recover from a security
机制或从安全

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,360
attack the security mechanism must be proactive as well as reactive
攻击中恢复 安全机制必须是主动的和被动的

99
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
suppose if there is an attack that has happened so the security mechanism

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
should come into action and recover the system to its original state

101
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
the security system not only react to the attack but should also prevent

102
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
attack before it happens and not only this it should also detect
发生之前阻止攻击，不仅如此，它还应该检测

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
any attack if it has happened so this is about the security mechanism
任何攻击，如果它发生了，所以这是关于安全机制

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,639
and coming to the last one the security services so security

105
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,440
services enhances the security counter security attacks and provide the

106
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,919
service see there are various services that we
