00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,740
side or the other.

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,530
other things can be on either side of the river.

165
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,500
So it would be two to the fourth she says aggressively

166
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,060
and without hesitation.

169
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,770
It's small enough.

170
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,620
There's another position over here with the farmer, fox,

173
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,660
And if we draw out the entire graph, it looks like this.

197
00:10:48,500 --> 00:11:04,820
So it's about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed

So this is a scattergram we made after the subject was

reasons, one of which is we asked people to self report on

how many lectures they thought they attended.

trend line goes up, different from whether it has something

to do with lectures producing good grades.

You might ask how I feel about the people up there on the

other upper left hand corner.

762
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,780
habitually in all the subjects you take at MIT, that you

Let me explain how that works to you.

We love to have people ask us what the class

average is on a quiz.

from zero to 100.

you had a thorough understanding of the material?

789
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,040
And what happens if you're down here is that you're

790
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,670
following off the edge of the range in which we think you

need to do more work.

792

So what we do is, we say that if you're in this range here--
所以我们所做的是，我们说，如果你在这个范围内——

793
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,520
following MIT convention with GPAs and stuff,
遵循 MIT 约定的 GPA 和其他东西，

794
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,440
that gets you a five.

If you're in this range down here, there's a

sharp drop off to four.

sharp fall off to three.

799
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,950
So that means if you're in the middle of one of those

800
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,790
plateaus there's no point in arguing with this.

Because it's not going to do you any good.

points are.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and start arguing.

we have in the course.

That is that your grade is calculated in several parts.

Part one is the max of your grade on Q1, and

part one of the final.
部分。

811
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,780
So in other words, you get two shots at everything.

So if you have complete glorious undeniable horrible F

well on that part of the final.
那部分表现出色，它就会在决赛中被抹去。

815
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,590
So each quiz has a corresponding

816
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,080
mirror on the final.

And now you say to me, I'm an MIT student.

expect everybody to do all of the final.

all of the final, all five parts of the final.
所有决赛，决赛的所有五个部分，将会有很大的时间压力。

827
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,890
So we have four quizzes.

828
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,590
And the final has a fifth part because there's some material
